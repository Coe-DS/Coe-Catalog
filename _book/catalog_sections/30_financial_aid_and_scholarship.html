<h3 data-number="30.0.3" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="need-based-financial-aid"><span class="header-section-number">30.0.3</span> Need-based Financial Aid</h3>
<p>Need-based financial aid is available to students who are admitted to Coe College and file the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). These assistance programs are based on the premise that students and parents should pay for college to the extent that they are able. Need-based financial aid is used to help make up the difference between the cost of college and what a family can afford.</p>
<p>When a FAFSA is filed, a standard formula is used to calculate the expected family contribution – the amount that the student and his or her family are expected to pay. The Student Financial Services Office compares the expected family contribution (EFC) to estimated cost of attendance. If the costs exceed the amount of the EFC, the student is eligible for need-based financial aid. A typical financial aid package will contain a combination of gift aid (scholarships and grants) and self-help aid (low-interest educational loans and employment). Information released to Coe College through the FAFSA application is kept confidential.</p>
<p>Application for all need-based financial aid programs must be made for each year the student is enrolled. The FAFSA is available online at <a href="www.fafsa.gov">Federal Student Aid</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Verification Process</strong></p>
<pre><code>Federal regulations require that some applicants who are eligible for need-based financial aid complete the verification process. Students may be chosen for verification by the U.S. Department of Education or by Coe College. Applicants selected for verification are required to submit supporting documentation to the Student Financial Services. These supporting documents may include, but are not limited to, copies of student and parent IRS tax transcripts from a prior tax year, verification of untaxed income received, family size and the number of family members attending college during the next academic year. Returning students selected for verification will not receive a financial aid award offer until all requested documents are received and reviewed by the Student Financial Services Office. Prospective students will receive a preliminary financial aid award offer prior to completion of verification. In order to finalize the awards offered, all requested documents should be received by the Student Financial Services Office at least one month prior to the end of the award period. A financial aid award is subject to change if verification results in a change to the Expected Family Contribution (EFC). During the verification process the Student Financial Services Office will contact students if clarification is needed on any of the information reported on the FAFSA or if it is necessary to make corrections to the FAFSA data. </code></pre>

<h3 data-number="30.0.4" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="need-based-gift-aid"><span class="header-section-number">30.0.4</span> Need-based Gift Aid</h3>
<p>Gift aid does not have to be repaid by the student. Need-based gift aid is available through federal, state, institutional and outside sources. + <strong>Coe Grant</strong> The value of a <strong>Coe Grant</strong> is influenced by a student’s financial need. The amount of the Coe Grant can vary from year to year, depending on changes in family income, room and board charges, and the availability of funding. Coe has many endowed scholarships that have been established by generous alumni and friends of the College. Income from these scholarships is used primarily to support Coe funded merit- and need-based aid. Students awarded Coe aid may be asked to complete an ‘Endowed Scholarship Application.’ The Financial Aid Office will use information from this application to match students with endowed scholarships. Students designated to have their Coe aid funded by an endowed scholarship may be contacted by the Coe College Advancement Office with information about their donor. (<strong>Note</strong>: Endowed scholarships funds support Coe funded aid already granted to the student. Under no circumstances will the student receive additional funding beyond what has already been listed on the financial aid award letter.) Endowed scholarship funds are vital sources of assistance for many of our students. It will be requested that each student receiving funds from an endowed scholarship write a letter of thanks to the donor or the designated official. Donor information and letter suggestions will be provided by the Office of Advancement.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Federal Pell Grant</strong> The Federal Pell Grant program is designed to provide financial assistance to eligible undergraduates. Application is made by filing a Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). The Federal Pell Grant program provides grants to full- and part-time students and may be used at any eligible college or university that the student attends as an undergraduate or until the student receive a first baccalaureate degree. The award amount may vary according to the cost of the institution and the number of hours for which a student is enrolled. A student may receive no more than the equivalent of 12 full-time term awards. Students must be enrolled for three or more course credits per term to receive the full award. At press time, the current 2022–2023 Federal Pell grants awards range from $750 up to $6,845. However, final Pell Grant amounts are subject to the federal budget process and could very well be reduced. These grants are generally available to families with modest incomes.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (SEOG)</strong> The Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (SEOG) program provides financial grant assistance to Pell Grant eligible undergraduates with exceptional financial need which, for the purposes of this program, is defined as those with the lowest EFC. The grants are made from funds provided by the federal government to Coe College. The College, in turn, selects needy students who have applied for financial aid and meet awarding criteria established by the federal government. SEOG awards at Coe are based on the availability of funding and can range from $100 up to $1,000 per academic year. These funds are limited and not all students who qualify can be assured that they will receive a SEOG grant.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Iowa Tuition Grant (ITG)</strong> The Iowa Tuition Grant (ITG) is available to qualified, undergraduate Iowa residents who are enrolled at least one quarter time (one course credit) at a private college in Iowa. A student may receive the ITG for no more than eight full-time terms. The ITG is based on financial need and a FAFSA filing deadline of July 1 <sup>st</sup>.Application to receive the ITG at Coe can be made by listing Coe College on the FAFSA. For the 2021-22 academic year, students whose Expected Family Contribution (EFC) is no greater than $15,000 may qualify for a maximum full-time award of $6,800.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>National Presbyterian Scholarships</strong> National Presbyterian Scholarships are offered to members of the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) who plan to attend one of the participating Presbyterian colleges, including Coe College. Students must file a separate application to the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) by December 1<sup>st</sup>. Only incoming first-year students may apply for these need-based renewable scholarships. (Applicants must complete the FAFSA to renew the scholarship.)</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH)</strong> The Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) program is designed to provide financial assistance of up to $4,000 per academic year to current and prospective teachers. To qualify for a TEACH Grant a student must have scored above the 75th percentile on any portion of the ACT or SAT (including composite scores) or have a 3.25 cumulative grade point average. First-year students must have a final cumulative high school grade point average of at least a 3.25 and upperclassmen must maintain a minimum cumulative GPA of 3.25 each Term. In addition, a recipient must serve as a full-time teacher in a high-need field, in a school serving low-income students for at least four academic years within eight years. If a student does not complete the required teaching obligation, the grant must be repaid as a Direct Unsubsidized Federal Direct Stafford Loan with interest from the time the grant was disbursed.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Active Duty Military Benefits</strong> An individual who is currently serving in the military or who is the spouse or dependent child of a service member who is currently serving on active duty, may be eligible for funding offered through the Department of Defense Tuition Assistance program. Applicants are encouraged to check their eligibility status and amount for which they qualify with their service prior to enrolling.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Iowa National Guard Educational Assistance Grant</strong> The Iowa National Guard Educational Assistance Grant (NGEAP) provides annual awards to Iowa National Guard members who attend eligible Iowa colleges and universities. Eligibility is determined by the Iowa Adjutant General. Maximum individual awards cannot exceed the current average resident tuition rate at Iowa Regent Universities. The maximum award amount for the 2021–22 academic year was $9,660.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>ROTC Scholarships and Grants</strong> ROTC Scholarships and Grants are available through Coe College. The College ROTC program provides on-campus leadership training in conjunction with a student’s current curriculum. The scholarship provides payment of up to full tuition and fees for a given academic year and approximately $600 per term for books, and a subsistence allowance of up to $500 per month up to 10 months per academic year. ROTC-eligible students should contact the Student Financial Services to determine the impact this scholarship will have on their total financial aid package.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Veterans’ Educational Benefits</strong> The Veterans Administration administers programs for veterans and service people seeking assistance for education and training. A veteran or dependent of a veteran who plans to receive educational benefits, as determined by the Department of Veteran Affairs, should contact the Registrar’s Office well in advance of enrollment to request certification. Additional information about veterans’ benefits at Coe College, such as the application process for the various programs, available resources, as well as withdrawal and readmit policies for service members, can be found on the <a href="https://www.coe.edu/admission/financial-aid-scholarships/resources/veterans-and-military-benefits">Coe College’s Resources for Veterans and Military Students.</a></p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Yellow Ribbon GI Educational Enhancement Program</strong> The Yellow Ribbon GI Educational Enhancement Program is a provision of the Post-9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2008. The program is designed to supplement the Post-9/11 tuition benefit, which is limited to the highest public in-state undergraduate tuition. Under the Yellow Ribbon program, Coe College entered into an agreement with the Department of Veterans Affairs to jointly pay the portion of an eligible veteran’s net tuition and fees that exceed the maximum amount otherwise provided by the Post-9/11 GI Bill. Veterans are encouraged to visit the VA’s Yellow Ribbon webpage to determine their eligibility. While not required to file a FAFSA, applicants are strongly encouraged to do so in order to potentially maximize federal and/or state benefits.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Vocational Rehabilitation Benefits</strong> The Division of Vocational and Rehabilitation of the Iowa Department of Public Instruction or a similar division in other states make assistance available to physically and mentally challenged students who are residents of the state. More information is available from the Division of Vocational Rehabilitation, 801 Bankers Trust Building, Des Moines, IA 50309, or the student’s home state office.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Veterans Benefits and Transition Act of 2018 Compliance</strong> Coe College abides by Section 103 of the Veterans Benefits and Transition Act of 2018. Our educational policy ensures that no penalty will be imposed including: 1) the assessment of late fees; 2) the denial of access to classes, libraries or other institutional facilities and /or 3) the requirements that a Chapter 31 or Chapter 33 recipient borrow additional funds to cover the individual’s inability to meet his or her financial obligations to the institution due to a delayed disbursement of payment by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs provided we have a current Certificate of Eligibility (C.O.E.) on file.</p></li>

<h3 data-number="30.0.7" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="federal-self-help-aid"><span class="header-section-number">30.0.7</span> Federal Self-help Aid</h3>
<p>Self-help aid may be need or non-need-based. Students apply for these funds by completing the FAFSA. Once awarded, the Student Financial Services will provide any additional paperwork that may be necessary. Self-help aid requires work for compensation or repayment of low-interest student loans. Eligibility for these programs is determined yearly and requires that the FAFSA be filed each year.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Work-Study Awards</strong> provide part-time employment on campus, at area non-profit agencies and in local schools.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>William D. Ford Federal Direct Stafford Loans</strong> William D. Ford Federal Direct Stafford Loans must be repaid by the student. The Federal Direct Stafford (FDS) loan program allows students to borrow low-interest loans directly from the federal government. To qualify for an FDS loan, a student must file the FAFSA, be admitted to a degree or certificate program, and be enrolled at least half-time (2.0 course credits).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Loan Types</strong></p>
<p>There are two types of Federal Direct Stafford loans: subsidized and unsubsidized. The interest rate for loans processed during the 2021–22 academic year is fixed at 3.73 percent. A 1.057% origination fee is subtracted from the loan funds. Please note, interest rates, subsidies, and origination fees may change. Updated information will be published as it becomes available.</p>
<p>A student must have financial need to receive a subsidized loan. Financial need is not required to be eligible for an unsubsidized loan. During the time that a student is enrolled on at least a half-time basis (two course credits per term) the federal government will pay the interest on a subsidized FDS loan. Interest will accrue during the in-school periods on an unsubsidized FDS loan. A student has the option of paying the interest during in-school periods or adding the interest to the principal of the loan. Principal payments begin after the six-month grace period.</p>
<p>Once a student is no longer enrolled at least half-time, repayment begins after a six-month grace period. During the grace period, the student will receive repayment information from the loan servicer, including the first payment due date. Information on the servicer assigned to a student’s loans can be looked up on <a href="studentaid.gov.">Federal Student Aid</a></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Federal Direct Parent Loan for Undergraduate Student’s (PLUS)</strong> Parents who can demonstrate good credit may borrow the difference between the student’s costs of attendance less financial assistance. Both custodial and non-custodial parents can borrow through the PLUS loan program in order to meet their obligation to the student’s costs at Coe. The interest rate for loans processed during the 2021–22 academic year is fixed at 6.28 %. A 4.228% origination fee is subtracted from the loan funds. Repayment begins 60 days after the loan is fully disbursed unless the borrower requests to defer payment while the student is enrolled.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Federal Direct PLUS Loan Program for Graduate Students</strong><br>
Federal Direct PLUS Loan Program for Graduate Students must be repaid by the student. The terms and conditions applicable to the Parent PLUS Loan (made to parents of dependent students) also apply to PLUS Loans made to graduate students.</p></li>

<p><strong>Financial Aid Satisfactory Academic Progress Policy — Academic Year 22–23</strong></p>
<pre><code>The Student Financial Services Office is required to monitor students who receive federal financial aid to determine if they are making satisfactory academic progress (SAP) toward their degree program.

SAP standards apply to all students receiving federal, state, and institutional financial aid. These standards apply to a student’s entire degree program including terms for which financial aid was not applied or for which enrollment was less than full-time.  

SAP of federal financial aid recipients is measured each term of the academic year[^1] for which a student is enrolled. The specific criteria of SAP, and the consequences to the student if progress is not achieved, is outlined in the following SAP Policy. Students should contact the Student Financial Services with questions regarding the intent or the interpretation of these standards.

SAP is measured in three components: Cumulative Grade Point Average (GPA); Pace (Completion Rate); and Maximum Time Frame Limitation.</code></pre>

<li><strong>Maximum Time Frame:</strong> A student must complete his or her educational program within 150% of the published length of the program measured in attempted course credits or credit hours. For example: the majority of undergraduate programs at Coe College require 32 course credits for graduation. A student can receive federal financial aid for a maximum of 48 attempted cc (32cc x 1.5). A student pursuing a double major/minor or a student who changed majors will normally be expected to complete all degree requirements before reaching 150 percent of attempted cc required to complete a program.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Financial Aid Warning</strong> A student who does not meet the minimum SAP standards for GPA and Pace will be placed on Financial Aid Warning for the subsequent term. Federal financial aid can be received during a Financial Aid Warning Term. A Financial Aid Warning notice is sent to the student by the Student Financial Services Office at the beginning of the warning term.</p>
<p><strong>Financial Aid Suspension</strong> A student who fails to meet SAP during the warning term is no longer eligible to receive federal financial aid and is placed on Financial Aid Suspension. The Student Financial Services Office will notify the student of his or her financial aid suspension; the notice will include information on the financial aid appeal process.</p>
<p><strong>Financial Aid Appeal</strong> A student may appeal his or her financial aid suspension by completing the SAP Appeal Form. The appeal must be submitted to the Student Financial Services Office as soon as possible and must include an explanation of why the student failed to meet SAP and what has changed in the student’s situation that would allow him or her to meet SAP standards during the term. Circumstances are limited and cannot be based upon a student’s need for assistance or the lack of knowledge that financial aid assistance was in jeopardy. Examples of possible situations include documented serious illness, severe injury, death of a family member, or other circumstances that prevented the student from meeting SAP standards. The Financial Aid Appeal Committee will review the appeal and notify the student of the outcome within 14 days of the receipt of a completed Financial Aid Appeal Form. A student whose appeal is denied will be granted a 100 percent refund of tuition charges if they officially drop all courses.</p>
<p><strong>Financial Aid Probation</strong> A student who successfully appeals his or her financial aid suspension is placed on Financial Aid Probation. Federal financial aid can be received for the term a student is on Financial Aid Probation.</p>
<p><strong>Academic Plan</strong> In most cases a student must complete an academic plan. An Academic Plan is generally developed based on a student’s individual needs and is completed with Learning Commons staff. A student whose appeal has been granted based on an Academic Plan must continually meet the terms of the plan in order to receive federal financial aid. If a student fails to meet the terms of the plan, the student loses financial aid eligibility and is placed on Financial Aid Suspension.</p>
<p><strong>Regaining Eligibility when a Financial Aid Appeal has not been granted</strong> If a Financial Aid Probation Appeal is denied or an appeal was never submitted, the student may regain eligibility to receive financial aid by completing a number of courses without receiving federal financial aid. It is the student’s responsibility to contact the Student Financial Services Office if he or she can demonstrate that SAP standards are being met or that an academic plan has been developed that, if followed, will ensure the student is able to meet SAP standards by a specific point in time.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Audited Courses</strong> Audited courses do not count towards degree requirements and do not impact SAP.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Status Mark of I</strong> Courses for which a grade has not been reported at the time of the SAP evaluation will be counted as attempted credits. Credit is not earned and GPA is not impacted. It is the student’s responsibility to inform the Student Financial Services once a grade has been reported.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Pass (P) – Not Pass (NP) Graded Courses</strong> Grades of “P” count as attempted credits and credits earned. Grades of “NP” count as attempted credits, but not credits earned. Grades of “P” and “NP” do not impact GPA.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Transfer Credits</strong> Courses that are transferred from another institution and <strong>accepted toward a degree program</strong> count as attempted and earned credits, but do not impact the cumulative GPA. Courses that are taken at another institution that are <strong>not accepted towards a degree program</strong> do not impact SAP standards.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Updating Coursework</strong> <strong>Successfully completed courses</strong> that are repeated are counted as attempted credits but not credits earned. The grade earned in a repeated course will replace the previously earned grade and may impact the cumulative GPA. A student must report any grade changes/updates that affect aid eligibility directly to the Student Financial Services Office.</p>
<p><strong>Failed courses</strong> that are repeated are counted as attempted and earned hours and therefore impact the cumulative GPA.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Status Marks of W and WF</strong> Courses for which a grade of “W” is recorded count as attempted credits. Courses for which a grade of “WF” is recorded count as attempted credits and impact GPA.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Part-time Students</strong> Coe grants and scholarships are not available to students who are enrolled part-time (fewer than 3.0 course credits). Federal and state grants and loans are available to part-time students at pro-rated amounts. Students changing their enrollment status from full-time to part-time must contact the Student Financial Services Office. To be eligible for a federal Direct Stafford Student loan, a student must be enrolled for a minimum of two course credits. Students who are enrolled for fewer than two course credits do not qualify for an in-school deferment status on existing federal loans.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Fifth Year of Study</strong> Financial aid beyond eight terms is generally limited to federal and some state aid. Students are encouraged to file a Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) for federal and state financial aid, although both types of financial aid also have statutory limits. For students who received a federal Pell grant, the equivalent of 12 full-time terms is the maximum. For students receiving the Iowa Tuition Grant, eight full-time terms are the maximum. Federal and state financial aid eligibility ends once students have satisfied all requirements for their particular areas of study. (See Financial Aid Satisfactory Academic Progress Policy, <a href="#sec-financial-aid-satisfactory-academic-prgress-policy"><span>Section&nbsp;30.0.8</span></a> for additional restrictions.)</p>
<p>Students who received eight terms of Coe aid are not eligible for Coe-gift funds. However, students pursuing a fifth year of study may be eligible for a continuing student discount. Students who wish to apply for the continuing student discount should contact the Student Financial Services Office. Education and accounting majors who are in their fifth year of study may be eligible for a fifth-year tuition discount. Contact the respective academic departments and the Student Financial Services Office for more information.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Withdrawal and Leave of Absence from the College</strong></p></li>
</ul>
<p>When a student withdraws or takes a leave of absence from all classes during a term, it is the responsibility of the college to calculate a return of Title IV funds according to federal policy. (See Return of Title IV Funds/Institutional Refund Policy, <a href="29_financial_information.html#sec-federal-title-IV-refund-calculation-policy"><span>Section&nbsp;29.4.3</span></a> ) Students who are granted a leave of absence, and are not attending college elsewhere during the leave, generally are eligible to have their academic and talent-based scholarships renewed upon their return. Renewal of these scholarships is contingent upon meeting Satisfactory Academic Progress, see <a href="#sec-financial-aid-satisfactory-academic-prgress-policy"><span>Section&nbsp;30.0.8</span></a> . Students who are returning from a leave of absence and have attended college elsewhere may have their scholarship eligibility reevaluated.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Reporting Changes and Other Assistance</strong> Any change in a student’s enrollment status, financial circumstances, or residential status must be reported immediately to the Student Financial Services Office. Such a change may have an effect on the calculation of financial need and the resulting assistance offered. It is in the best interest of students to contact the Student Financial Services Office prior to an enrollment or residential status change.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Outside Scholarships and Loans</strong> All aid received from sources outside of Coe College must be reported to the Student Financial Services Office. Outside assistance may include, but is not limited to: scholarships, tuition reimbursement, private student loans, etc. These funds may cause a change in financial aid eligibility.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Appeals</strong> A student has the right to appeal any decision concerning financial aid eligibility or award in writing to the Director of Financial Aid. To do so, contact the Director of Financial Aid.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Off-Campus Study</strong> Coe-administered financial aid, with the exception of the National Tuition Exchange (NTE) Program benefits, may be used for off-campus study if approved by the Committee on Internationalization. Students are responsible for any additional costs of the programs. Applications to use Coe aid should be filed with the Director of Off-Campus Studies. Enrollment in an off-campus study program approved for credit by Coe qualifies the student to be considered for assistance from federal and state grant and loan programs.
