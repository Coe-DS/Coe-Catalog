    "text": "COE COLLEGE is a private, four-year co-educational liberal arts college that was founded in 1851 and is historically affiliated with the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), yet is ecumenical in practice and outlook.\n\n2.0.1 LOCATION\nCoe is located just 225 miles west of Chicago in Iowa’s second largest city, Cedar Rapids (metropolitan population 175,000). The city is easily accessible by the interstate highway system, bus services and several airlines.\n\n\n2.0.2 CAMPUS\nSituated on 65 acres in the center of the metropolitan area, the campus is urban but enclosed, with 30 buildings occupying an attractive landscape.\n\n\n2.0.3 ENROLLMENT\nThe student body of approximately 1,400 students represents most states and around 15 foreign countries. All students are required to live on campus unless they are residents of Cedar Rapids.\n\n\n2.0.4 LIBRARY\nStewart Memorial Library is in the very center of the main campus. It contains over 500,000 volumes and 16,000 pieces of media, and subscribes to 3,500 print and online periodical subscriptions providing access to over 100 databases. Coe’s library offers students a variety of research assistance, study areas, a small theater, preview room, a media editing room, and a 3D printer and laser cutter. The Library houses the Learning Commons and the College’s permanent art collection.\n\n\n2.0.5 ACCREDITATION\nCoe College is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission (hlcomission.org), an institutional accreditation agency recognized by the U.S. Department of Education. Coe College’s Bachelor of Music program is accredited by the National Association of Schools of Music; its education program is accredited by the Iowa Department of Education, and its Bachelor of Science in Nursing is accredited by the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education (http://aacn.nche.edu/ccne-accreditation).  Coe College’s chemistry program is certified by the American Chemical Society.  Copies of accrediting and approval statements are available online at https://www.coe.edu/why-coe/consumer-information.\n\n\n2.0.6 MEMBERSHIPS\nCoe is a charter member of the Associated Colleges of the Midwest, whose other members are: Beloit, Carleton, Colorado, Cornell, Grinnell, Knox, Lake Forest, Lawrence, Luther, Macalester, Monmouth, Ripon, and St. Olaf. Other memberships include: Phi Beta Kappa, Phi Kappa Phi, the National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities, the American Association of Colleges and Universities, Council on Undergraduate Research, the Association of Presbyterian Colleges and Universities, the American Rivers Conference, and the National Collegiate Athletic Association.\n\n\n2.0.7 ACADEMIC PROGRAM\nAcademic areas of study are offered in managerial or public accounting, African American studies, art, art history, Asian studies, biology, business administration, chemistry, communication studies, computer science, creative writing, data science, economics, elementary education, English, film studies, French & francophone studies, interdisciplinary French & francophone studies, general science, history, international business, international economics, international studies, kinesiology, literature, mathematics, music (B.A. or B.M.), nursing (B.S.N.), philosophy, physics, political science, psychology, religion, social & criminal justice, sociology, Spanish, Spanish studies, theatre arts, and writing.

Various vocal and instrumental ensembles are available for course credit.\n\n\n2.0.9 FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE\nCoe College is committed to assisting those families in need of financial assistance. The average aid package for incoming students enrolled during the 2021–2022 academic year totaled more than $48,000. The total cost of full-time tuition, room, board, and activity fee for the 2021–2022 academic year is $59,324.\n\n\n2.0.10 HISTORY OF COE COLLEGE\nCoe College claims the shortest name of any American institution of higher education, but the school has actually carried five titles through its history. When the Rev. Williston Jones founded the college in 1851, he called it The School for the Prophets. Cedar Rapids’ first resident minister opened the parlor of his home to a group of young men with the goal of educating them for the ministry to serve churches in the Midwest. Two years later, while Jones was canvassing churches in the East for money to send three of his students to Eastern seminaries, a Catskills farmer named Daniel Coe stepped forward with a pledge of $1,500 and urged Jones to start his own college in the frontier town of Cedar Rapids. Legend has it that the $1,500 raised by Coe was brought west from New York, sewn into the petticoat of a lady visitor traveling by stagecoach to Iowa. Coe gave this generous gift with the stipulation that the proposed institute should be “made available for the education of females as well as males.” Accordingly, Coe was coeducational from its founding.\nWith Jones’ blessing, the Cedar Rapids Collegiate Institute was incorporated in 1853 by a group of Cedar Rapids leaders chaired by Judge George Greene. They used Daniel Coe’s money to purchase two downtown lots for the school and 80 acres of farmland on what was then the edge of town. The farm evolved into today’s campus. In 1868, in a failed attempt to secure the Lewis Parsons estate, the trustees renamed the school Parsons Seminary. After a period of severe financial difficulties, the institution was reestablished in honor of its original benefactor as the Coe Collegiate Institute in 1875.\nT.M Sinclair, founder of the Sinclair Meat Packing Company, played the key financial role in the final step toward the firm establishment of Coe College. Sinclair liquidated all the debt from Parsons Seminary and the Cedar Rapids Collegiate Institute. The Sinclair gift made it practical for the property of the Coe Collegiate Institute—including the original land paid for by Daniel Coe—to be transferred to Coe College with the Iowa Presbyterian Synod to assume major responsibility for the institution. Coe College has operated continuously since its incorporation under that name on Feb. 2, 1881. From the first, the College was committed to intellectual excellence. It has continued in this tradition ever since.\nThe compact campus on the east edge of Cedar Rapids grew with many building projects in its early years, including Old Main (1868), Williston Hall (1881), Marshall Hall (1900), the first gymnasium (1904), and the first T.M. Sinclair Memorial Chapel (1911). In 1907, Coe earned accreditation from the North Central Association of Colleges and Universities. Over the decades, Coe’s reputation as a superior liberal arts college has continued to grow. One recognition of this came in 1949, when Coe was granted a Phi Beta Kappa chapter, a distinction reserved for about 10% of American colleges and universities.\nCentral to the educational philosophy of Coe College is the belief that a liberal arts education is the best preparation for life. Students have the opportunity to experience a variety of subjects outside their respective programs of study. Coe offers more than 40 areas of study that cover a range of fields. The College awards the following undergraduate degrees: Bachelor of Arts (B.A.), Bachelor of Music (B.M.), and Bachelor of Science in Nursing (B.S.N.).\nThere are a number of factors that contribute to Coe College’s strong academic quality. The key to Coe’s tradition of excellence in academic quality relates directly to small class sizes and the interest shown by professors to make learning a personalized experience. At Coe, the average class size is 16, and the student-faculty ratio is 11:1. Classes are taught by our involved and committed faculty, 91% of whom hold the highest degree in their field. This means classes are taught by experienced professionals who have in-depth knowledge of their subjects. To provide students with a well-rounded experience and solid preparation for the future, Coe offers, along with quality instruction from superb faculty, an abundance of out-of-class opportunities which include student-faculty collaborative research, honors projects, service learning, and internships. Within one year of graduation, according to the annual survey results from the Center for Creativity and Careers, 98% of Coe graduates are engaged in post-graduate activity such as employment, graduate school, military, or travel/adventure.\nWith the addition of the east campus, Coe has nearly doubled in size since 1989. New facilities on the east side of College Drive include Athletic Recreation Center (2017), Clark Racquet Center and athletic fields (1989), Clark Alumni House (1993), Nassif House (1999), and four student apartment buildings (Morris House and Schlarbaum House in 2000, Brandt House and Spivey House in 2002). McCabe Hall (2005), named in honor of former Coe President Joseph E. McCabe, houses the offices of the president, provost, advancement and alumni relations, and The Center for Creativity, Careers and Community (C3) making way for the remodeling of Coe’s oldest building, Stuart Hall, and the first significant addition of classroom space since Peterson Hall was built in the 1960s. In 2012 and 2013, Peterson Hall of Science was completely renovated to support Coe’s science programs. To further enhance the campus environment, Coe completed the largest capital project in its history in 2017. Make Your Move – the Campaign for Eby and Hickok – included $24 million in essential enhancements, including an Athletic and Recreation Complex project as well as the renovation and expansion of Hickok Hall, one of the College’s main academic buildings. The result is vastly improved academic, recreational, wellness and competition facilities to benefit future generations of students."

    "text": "The role of the academic advisor is to acquaint students with their academic options at Coe and assist them in selecting courses that reflect individual interests and abilities. Advisors also help students create a four-year education plan that allows students to make connections between disparate areas of study, and between academic, co-curricular, and non-academic areas. Students may change advisors at any time upon request to the Registrar.\nFirst-Year Seminar instructors serve as the primary academic advisors for first-year students in their respective sections. Students thus see their advisors frequently during their first term at Coe and have the opportunity to work closely with them in developing overall programs of study and long-range goals. After the first term, students may decide to choose departmental faculty for academic advising or they may continue to be advised by their First-Year Seminar instructors. Students are free to speak at any time with professors in their major departments to answer specific questions regarding requirements and courses in those departments."

    "text": "The student’s First-Year Experience at Coe is a deliberate strategy to engage first-year students across multiple dimensions of college life in the first year. Components of the First-Year Experience include writing exercises, various campus events, and the First-Year Seminar (FYS).\nThe First-Year Seminar is required for all students who have not yet completed a full-time college term after high school graduation. During the Fall Term, a variety of First-Year Seminars—topics courses exploring issues from multiple perspectives—are offered. The seminars emphasize critical thinking, writing, speaking and research skills.\nAll First-Year Seminars carry the writing emphasis designation. First-Year Seminar courses cannot fulfill any distributional, cultural perspective, or major requirements. Students who drop or fail their First-Year Seminar are required to complete a replacement course designated by the Registrar the following term. The completion of this Spring Term course makes it possible for the student to fulfill the FYS graduation requirement. For students who fail the Fall Term First-Year Seminar, successful completion of the Spring Term course also allows the grade in the FYS to be changed from “F” to “NP” on the transcript.\nStudents who begin their college enrollment in the Spring Term must also complete a course designated as a replacement."

    "text": "Writing Across the Curriculum: Statement of Guiding Principles\nAs stated in the Coe College Mission Statement, our reason to exist as an institution is to ready students intellectually, professionally, and socially to lead productive and satisfying lives in the global society of the 21st century. In accordance with this mission, our curriculum requires that students undertake “a series of intensive writing experiences, spread across four years of study.” This requirement is known as Writing Across the Curriculum, the guiding principles of which are detailed below.\nAs a philosophy, Writing Across the Curriculum asserts that writing is most effectively learned in context: to varied audiences, with varied purposes. In adopting this philosophy, Coe College has committed to making writing-intensive experiences available to students in all disciplines. Known as “Writing Emphasis” credits, these courses are divergent in subject matter but aligned in their commitment to giving students content-rich and context-specific writing experiences that foster a critical flexibility in transferring knowledge about effective writing to multiple, even unknown, contexts.\nTherefore, students who complete the requisite number of writing emphasis courses will graduate from Coe knowing that writing is both a means and an end: a method for exploring ideas and deepening one’s knowledge as well as a tool for sharing that knowledge and expressing one’s point of view. Similarly, graduating students will know that the practice of writing is a recursive process rooted in revision, which refers both to the reconsideration of one’s ideas and to the refinement of prose, and this process unfolds over a lifetime. Understanding that students will encounter innumerable writing situations in their lives, many of which may be unfamiliar to them, they will graduate from Coe having developed the confidence and self-efficacy necessary to adapt or draw from their existing knowledge in order to navigate new contexts.\nAlthough many courses at Coe may include writing activities, courses endorsed by Writing Across the Curriculum are those in which: - Students are given opportunities to practice revision, whether via multiple drafts of a single project or multiple iterations of the same type of assignment; - Students receive instructor feedback on written work to facilitate revision; and - Writing assignments are frequent enough that they are integral to the learning throughout the course, enabling students to develop in one or more of the following learning outcomes, as appropriate to discipline and course objectives: - How to write for specific purposes and audiences - Including attention to the ways purposes and audiences shape form, mode, voice, method, organization, engagement with and citation of research, and/or creativity and imagination - How to engage in critical thinking - Particularly how to conduct analysis, how to synthesize information, how to interpret and/or use evidence and data, and how to present one’s ideas coherently and stylistically - How to practice, assess, and develop effective habits for writing - Specifically, how to read deeply, how to begin and later practice selection in research, how to be a skilled reader of one’s own and others’ in-process writing, how to accept and interpret feedback, and how to revise writing, all of which are parts of the process of learning how to have and develop ideas - How to engage in writing as a method for learning and discovery - For deepening knowledge, thinking through questions and problems, and reflecting on connections and growth - How to name and describe one’s own knowledge for others - For example, in the form of personal statements for application to graduate study, cover letters and resumes for entering and advancing in the workforce, or other forms of self-summary that facilitate transition from the baccalaureate environment through the broader public.\nMany writing emphasis sections are offered each year, and, in addition, the College’s rhetoric department offers several interdisciplinary writing courses designed to guide students learning to write effectively at the college level. (See course descriptions starting on p. 70). General Education or major courses that are also designated as writing emphasis courses may be used to satisfy both requirements.\nIn this catalog, writing emphasis courses are designated by a (WE) after the course title, e.g. “RHE-200 Rhetorical Theory & Practice (WE).” In other contexts, the course code may end with a “W” (e.g. RHE-200-W). All sections of such a course, regardless of instructor, will carry writing emphasis credit.\nFulfilling the Writing Emphasis Requirement:\nOnly designated WE courses in which a student earns a grade of “C” (2.0) or better count toward fulfillment of this requirement.\nOnly designated courses taken at Coe College count toward fulfillment of this requirement.\nUndergraduate degree-seeking* students - who start at Coe College or who transfer fewer than 8 course credits earned after graduation from high school must complete at least 5 writing emphasis courses. Of these 5, one will usually be the FYS. Of the remaining 4, it is recommended (but not required) that at least 1 be taken outside the student’s intended major(s). - who transfer at least 8 but fewer than 16 course credits to Coe, earned after graduation from high school, must complete at least 3 writing emphasis courses. - who transfer 16 or more course credits to Coe, earned after graduation from high school, must complete at least 2 writing emphasis credits. For all students, regardless of transfer credit, it is recommended (but not required) that at least one writing emphasis course be taken in the upper division within the student’s intended major(s). “Upper division” courses are defined in this case as those numbered 300 and above; upper division writing emphasis courses could include both scheduled classroom courses and arranged writing-based capstone projects (such as a thesis). See Departmental Writing Plans for more information on writing in the major(s). *Students seeking a second undergraduate degree from Coe should see Second Baccalaureate Degree p. 16.\n\n11.0.0.1 COURSE NUMBERING\n\nCourses numbered 100–199 are introductory to the subject.\nCourses numbered 200–299 assume a capacity for the independent acquisition of material and generally build on the methods and subject matter of 100-level courses.\nCourses numbered 300–399 are typically oriented toward a major or minor. They require a strong foundation of knowledge specific to the discipline.\nCourses numbered 400–499 are courses in the major or minor that are designed to challenge students to integrate discipline-specific knowledge in advanced ways. These courses typically contain advanced disciplinary coursework, capstone projects, and/or independent research."

Such experiences occur best when students are living and learning full-time on campus. The residential life program is an integral part of the education program and support services at Coe College. Residence halls and hall staff provide a structure by which the experience of the classroom is joined with the out-of-class learning experience of the student.\nFull-time students are required to live in residence and take meals in the college dining hall and, thereby, are charged for room and board unless exempt for one or more of the following reasons: 1. Married students – must provide copy of signed marriage license 2. Live with parent(s)/guardian(s) within 25 miles of campus (address on file with College is verified) 3. Dependent child (person must provide copy of child’s birth certificate) 4. Completed 8 semesters living on campus 5. Students who are 25 years or older.\nOther exceptions to the residence requirement must be applied for in writing to the Dean of Students. Approval or denial is determined on a case-by-case basis following evaluation of the extenuating circumstances provided for review. Students are notified in writing of the decision. Permission to live off campus must be on file in the Residence Life Office and must be renewed each year. Students who violate the residence requirement are charged full room and board costs for the entire year. Coe funded scholarships and grants will typically be reduced by approximately 10 percent when a student moves off campus.\n\n\n29.1.5 ACM and Other Off-Campus Study Programs\nStudents desiring to study off-campus must first obtain approval from the Director of Off-Campus study. In every case, students are responsible for their own transportation and living expenses. Each student is advised to check with the program’s director as to the cost (and other details) of each program. This charge could vary significantly from the cost of remaining on campus. The tuition charged for Fall or Spring Term off-campus programs will be Coe’s tuition or the tuition for the off-campus program if greater than Coe’s tuition. In addition to tuition, Coe will charge the off-campus program fee as billed by the off-campus program. Students maintain their eligibility for federal and state financial aid; however, Coe financial aid availability is subject to approval by the Committee on Internationalization. Students registered for the optional May Term who desire to study off-campus (except Coe-sponsored programs) are billed a surcharge fee for tuition and/or program costs which are greater than 10% of Coe’s annual tuition. Tuition and fees for ACM off-campus study programs or study programs sponsored by other colleges must be paid in full prior to attending the off-campus program.\nNOTE: Students on regular-term Coe-administered programs including exchanges are able to use their Coe College gift aid to pay tuition that term. Domestic students on other providers’ programs may be able to utilize a portion of their Coe gift aid. International students may be able to utilize a portion of their Coe gift aid toward tuition for ACM or other providers’ domestic but not international programs. In all cases, students in an off-campus program are not charged the student-activity or health fee."

    "text": "29.4 FINANCIAL IMPACT OF WITHDRAWING OR CEASING ATTENDANCE IN ALL COURSES\n\n29.4.1 Official Withdrawal from all Courses\nStudents who withdraw from or cease attendance in all of their courses have the responsibility of initiating the official withdrawal process (see (official-withdrawal-process?) ).\nIf a student is unable to complete the official withdrawal process, the intent to withdraw can be communicated to one of the following offices: Registrar, Student Financial Services, Student Life, Student Success and Persistence.\nSpecial consideration is given to students who withdrew due to a call to active duty. Coe’s “Military Call Up/Refund” and “Readmission of Service Member” policies are published on the Admission/Financial Aid webpage. Copies of these policies can be requested from the Student Financial Services Office.\n\n\n29.4.2 Unofficial Withdrawal from all Courses\nStudents who did not earn credit for any of the courses they were registered for in a given term and did not officially withdraw or otherwise provide notice of their intent to withdraw, must be considered “unofficially withdrawn”. Federal regulations mandate that, a federal Title IV refund calculation, using the withdrawal date of either the midpoint of the term or the last date of attendance at a documented academically related activity, must be performed.\nA student’s withdrawal date is: The earlier of the date that the student began the official withdrawal process or otherwise provided official notification to a designated office of their intent to withdraw; OR If official notification could not be provided because of circumstances beyond the student’s control, the date the college determines is related to the particular circumstance; OR If the student ceased attendance without providing official notification, the midpoint of the term; OR The student’s last date of attendance at a documented academically related activity.\n\n\n29.4.3 Federal Title IV Refund Calculation/Policy\nIn accordance with federal regulations, a Title IV refund calculation must be performed for students that are recipients of Federal Student Aid (FSA) who cease attendance in all courses, including students who are expelled, or are granted a leave of absence. The FSA programs that are covered by this law are: Federal Pell Grants, TEACH Grants, Stafford Loans, PLUS Loans, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (FSEOG), Iraq Afghanistan Service Grant, and other Title IV Programs. The Coe College Student Financial Services Office determines, based on the *federally mandated formula, the amount of FSA assistance students have earned based on the date in the term a student is considered to be withdrawn. An example of the refund calculation is published online in the [Financial Aid Handbook] (https://www.coe.edu/admission/financial-aid-scholarships/financial-aid-handbook) and a handout may be obtained from the Student Financial Services Office.\n\n\n29.4.4 Return of Financial Aid Funds Policy Steps\n\nStep 1: Determine the percentage of enrollment period completed by the student. If the calculated percentage is equal to or greater than 60%, the student has “earned” all aid for the enrollment period and no adjustment in financial aid occurs.\nDays Attended ÷ Days in Enrollment Period = Percentage Completed\nStep 2: Apply the percentage completed to the Title IV aid award to determine the student’s eligibility for financial aid prior to the withdrawal.\n(Total Aid Disbursed + Aid that could have been disbursed) x Percentage Completed = Earned Aid\nStep 3: Determine the amount of unearned financial aid to be returned to the appropriate Title IV financial aid program.\nTotal Disbursed Aid – Earned Aid = Unearned Aid to be Returned\n\nIf the aid already disbursed equals the earned aid, no further action is required.\nIf the aid already disbursed is greater than the earned aid, the difference must be returned to the appropriate Title IV aid program.\nIf the aid already disbursed is less than the earned aid, a late disbursement may be made to the student.\n\nStep 4: Determine if the institution and/or the student must return the unearned funds.\n\nTotal Aid – Earned Aid = Unearned aid that must be returned\nUnearned Aid &gt; assessed charges = Unearned aid that must be returned by the student\nUnearned Aid ≤ assessed charges = Unearned aid to be returned by the College\n\n\nThe Coe College Student Financial Service Office is required to return any unearned FSA funds that were applied towards institutional charges within 45 days in the following order: + Direct Unsubsidized Stafford Loan + Direct (Subsidized) Stafford Loan + Direct Graduate PLUS Loan (for graduate students) + Direct PLUS Loan (for parents of undergraduate students) + Pell Grant + SEOG + TEACH Grant + Iraq Afghanistan Service Grant\nThe student will be informed by the Student Financial Services Office of the type and amount of FSA program funds that are being returned on their behalf and of the amount the student must return. If the student’s portion of aid to be returned is a loan, the terms of the original loan repayment agreement will apply. The amount of unearned grant funds a student must repay is limited to the amount by which unearned grant funds disbursed exceed half of the original grant award by $50 or more. In general, the Student Financial Services Office will return the grant funds to the appropriate federal program and charge the student’s Coe account, which will result in debt to the college.\n\nStep 5: Determine earned FSA assistance that has not been disbursed.\nTotal Aid Earned – Total Aid Disbursed = Earned Aid not Disbursed\n\nGrant aid that was earned, but had not been applied before the student withdrew, will be applied to the students account within 45 days. Loan proceeds that could be disbursed after the student withdrew will only be disbursed if the student requests a disbursement within 14 days of receiving notice from the Student Financial Services of their eligibility of a post-withdrawal loan disbursement.\n\n\n29.4.5 Institutional Refund Calculation/Policy\nThe Student Financial Services will follow the federal Title IV Refund Calculation/ Policy in determining the amount of earned and unearned Coe scholarships and grants and state assistance.\nTuition, Board and Student Fees will be charged pro-rata based on the percentage of the enrollment period completed up to the 60-percentage point in time of the term. Room charge will not be refunded after Date of Record for the term. Please see the Coe Student Accounts Handbook to review the institutional refund policy for tuition, fees, room and board.\n\n\n29.4.6 May Term (optional)\nThe first May Term course taken by a student is a non-tuition charge term for all Coe full-time degree-seeking students enrolled in the Spring Term, therefore, no institutional aid is awarded to students. A $1000 fee per May Term course will be assessed for subsequent May Term courses taken by a student. Please see the Coe Student Accounts Handbook for more information about May Term.\n\n\n29.4.7 Enrollment Status Changes\nChanges in enrollment status from full-time to part-time may affect a student’s financial assistance. In general, the amount of financial aid a student is eligible to receive is based on the enrollment status as of the College’s official date of record. Federal direct loans will no longer be in an in-school deferment status for a student who drops below half-time at any time during the term Students should consult with the Student Financial Services to discuss how enrollment changes will affect their financial aid eligibility and loan deferment status.\n\n\n29.4.8 Part-Time Students\nA part-time student withdrawing from all courses in the Fall or Spring Terms shall be subject to Return of Title IV Funds/Institutional Refund Policy, see Section 29.4.3 for more information.\n\n\n29.4.9 Summer Students\nA summer student withdrawing from class will be subject to Return of Title IV Funds/Institutional Refund Policy (see Section 29.4.3 ) which credits earned aid and assessed charges on a prorated basis predicated on the term/session enrolled."
