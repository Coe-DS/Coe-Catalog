    "text": "COE COLLEGE is a private, four-year co-educational liberal arts college that was founded in 1851 and is historically affiliated with the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), yet is ecumenical in practice and outlook.\n\n2.0.1 LOCATION\nCoe is located just 225 miles west of Chicago in Iowa’s second largest city, Cedar Rapids (metropolitan population 175,000). The city is easily accessible by the interstate highway system, bus services and several airlines.\n\n\n2.0.2 CAMPUS\nSituated on 65 acres in the center of the metropolitan area, the campus is urban but enclosed, with 30 buildings occupying an attractive landscape.\n\n\n2.0.3 ENROLLMENT\nThe student body of approximately 1,400 students represents most states and around 15 foreign countries. All students are required to live on campus unless they are residents of Cedar Rapids.\n\n\n2.0.4 LIBRARY\nStewart Memorial Library is in the very center of the main campus. It contains over 500,000 volumes and 16,000 pieces of media, and subscribes to 3,500 print and online periodical subscriptions providing access to over 100 databases. Coe’s library offers students a variety of research assistance, study areas, a small theater, preview room, a media editing room, and a 3D printer and laser cutter. The Library houses the Learning Commons and the College’s permanent art collection.\n\n\n2.0.5 ACCREDITATION\nCoe College is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission (hlcomission.org), an institutional accreditation agency recognized by the U.S. Department of Education. Coe College’s Bachelor of Music program is accredited by the National Association of Schools of Music; its education program is accredited by the Iowa Department of Education, and its Bachelor of Science in Nursing is accredited by the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education (http://aacn.nche.edu/ccne-accreditation).  Coe College’s chemistry program is certified by the American Chemical Society.  Copies of accrediting and approval statements are available online at https://www.coe.edu/why-coe/consumer-information.\n\n\n2.0.6 MEMBERSHIPS\nCoe is a charter member of the Associated Colleges of the Midwest, whose other members are: Beloit, Carleton, Colorado, Cornell, Grinnell, Knox, Lake Forest, Lawrence, Luther, Macalester, Monmouth, Ripon, and St. Olaf. Other memberships include: Phi Beta Kappa, Phi Kappa Phi, the National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities, the American Association of Colleges and Universities, Council on Undergraduate Research, the Association of Presbyterian Colleges and Universities, the American Rivers Conference, and the National Collegiate Athletic Association.\n\n\n2.0.7 ACADEMIC PROGRAM\nAcademic areas of study are offered in managerial or public accounting, African American studies, art, art history, Asian studies, biology, business administration, chemistry, communication studies, computer science, creative writing, data science, economics, elementary education, English, film studies, French & francophone studies, interdisciplinary French & francophone studies, general science, history, international business, international economics, international studies, kinesiology, literature, mathematics, music (B.A. or B.M.), nursing (B.S.N.), philosophy, physics, political science, psychology, religion, social & criminal justice, sociology, Spanish, Spanish studies, theatre arts, and writing.

Various vocal and instrumental ensembles are available for course credit.\n\n\n2.0.9 FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE\nCoe College is committed to assisting those families in need of financial assistance. The average aid package for incoming students enrolled during the 2021–2022 academic year totaled more than $48,000. The total cost of full-time tuition, room, board, and activity fee for the 2021–2022 academic year is $59,324.\n\n\n2.0.10 HISTORY OF COE COLLEGE\nCoe College claims the shortest name of any American institution of higher education, but the school has actually carried five titles through its history. When the Rev. Williston Jones founded the college in 1851, he called it The School for the Prophets. Cedar Rapids’ first resident minister opened the parlor of his home to a group of young men with the goal of educating them for the ministry to serve churches in the Midwest. Two years later, while Jones was canvassing churches in the East for money to send three of his students to Eastern seminaries, a Catskills farmer named Daniel Coe stepped forward with a pledge of $1,500 and urged Jones to start his own college in the frontier town of Cedar Rapids. Legend has it that the $1,500 raised by Coe was brought west from New York, sewn into the petticoat of a lady visitor traveling by stagecoach to Iowa. Coe gave this generous gift with the stipulation that the proposed institute should be “made available for the education of females as well as males.” Accordingly, Coe was coeducational from its founding.\nWith Jones’ blessing, the Cedar Rapids Collegiate Institute was incorporated in 1853 by a group of Cedar Rapids leaders chaired by Judge George Greene. They used Daniel Coe’s money to purchase two downtown lots for the school and 80 acres of farmland on what was then the edge of town. The farm evolved into today’s campus. In 1868, in a failed attempt to secure the Lewis Parsons estate, the trustees renamed the school Parsons Seminary. After a period of severe financial difficulties, the institution was reestablished in honor of its original benefactor as the Coe Collegiate Institute in 1875.\nT.M Sinclair, founder of the Sinclair Meat Packing Company, played the key financial role in the final step toward the firm establishment of Coe College. Sinclair liquidated all the debt from Parsons Seminary and the Cedar Rapids Collegiate Institute. The Sinclair gift made it practical for the property of the Coe Collegiate Institute—including the original land paid for by Daniel Coe—to be transferred to Coe College with the Iowa Presbyterian Synod to assume major responsibility for the institution. Coe College has operated continuously since its incorporation under that name on Feb. 2, 1881. From the first, the College was committed to intellectual excellence. It has continued in this tradition ever since.\nThe compact campus on the east edge of Cedar Rapids grew with many building projects in its early years, including Old Main (1868), Williston Hall (1881), Marshall Hall (1900), the first gymnasium (1904), and the first T.M. Sinclair Memorial Chapel (1911). In 1907, Coe earned accreditation from the North Central Association of Colleges and Universities. Over the decades, Coe’s reputation as a superior liberal arts college has continued to grow. One recognition of this came in 1949, when Coe was granted a Phi Beta Kappa chapter, a distinction reserved for about 10% of American colleges and universities.\nCentral to the educational philosophy of Coe College is the belief that a liberal arts education is the best preparation for life. Students have the opportunity to experience a variety of subjects outside their respective programs of study. Coe offers more than 40 areas of study that cover a range of fields. The College awards the following undergraduate degrees: Bachelor of Arts (B.A.), Bachelor of Music (B.M.), and Bachelor of Science in Nursing (B.S.N.).\nThere are a number of factors that contribute to Coe College’s strong academic quality. The key to Coe’s tradition of excellence in academic quality relates directly to small class sizes and the interest shown by professors to make learning a personalized experience. At Coe, the average class size is 16, and the student-faculty ratio is 11:1. Classes are taught by our involved and committed faculty, 91% of whom hold the highest degree in their field. This means classes are taught by experienced professionals who have in-depth knowledge of their subjects. To provide students with a well-rounded experience and solid preparation for the future, Coe offers, along with quality instruction from superb faculty, an abundance of out-of-class opportunities which include student-faculty collaborative research, honors projects, service learning, and internships. Within one year of graduation, according to the annual survey results from the Center for Creativity and Careers, 98% of Coe graduates are engaged in post-graduate activity such as employment, graduate school, military, or travel/adventure.\nWith the addition of the east campus, Coe has nearly doubled in size since 1989. New facilities on the east side of College Drive include Athletic Recreation Center (2017), Clark Racquet Center and athletic fields (1989), Clark Alumni House (1993), Nassif House (1999), and four student apartment buildings (Morris House and Schlarbaum House in 2000, Brandt House and Spivey House in 2002). McCabe Hall (2005), named in honor of former Coe President Joseph E. McCabe, houses the offices of the president, provost, advancement and alumni relations, and The Center for Creativity, Careers and Community (C3) making way for the remodeling of Coe’s oldest building, Stuart Hall, and the first significant addition of classroom space since Peterson Hall was built in the 1960s. In 2012 and 2013, Peterson Hall of Science was completely renovated to support Coe’s science programs. To further enhance the campus environment, Coe completed the largest capital project in its history in 2017. Make Your Move – the Campaign for Eby and Hickok – included $24 million in essential enhancements, including an Athletic and Recreation Complex project as well as the renovation and expansion of Hickok Hall, one of the College’s main academic buildings. The result is vastly improved academic, recreational, wellness and competition facilities to benefit future generations of students."

    "section": "",
    "text": "The role of the academic advisor is to acquaint students with their academic options at Coe and assist them in selecting courses that reflect individual interests and abilities. Advisors also help students create a four-year education plan that allows students to make connections between disparate areas of study, and between academic, co-curricular, and non-academic areas. Students may change advisors at any time upon request to the Registrar.\nFirst-Year Seminar instructors serve as the primary academic advisors for first-year students in their respective sections. Students thus see their advisors frequently during their first term at Coe and have the opportunity to work closely with them in developing overall programs of study and long-range goals. After the first term, students may decide to choose departmental faculty for academic advising or they may continue to be advised by their First-Year Seminar instructors. Students are free to speak at any time with professors in their major departments to answer specific questions regarding requirements and courses in those departments."

Components of the First-Year Experience include writing exercises, various campus events, and the First-Year Seminar (FYS).\nThe First-Year Seminar is required for all students who have not yet completed a full-time college term after high school graduation. During the Fall Term, a variety of First-Year Seminars—topics courses exploring issues from multiple perspectives—are offered. The seminars emphasize critical thinking, writing, speaking and research skills.\nAll First-Year Seminars carry the writing emphasis designation. First-Year Seminar courses cannot fulfill any distributional, cultural perspective, or major requirements. Students who drop or fail their First-Year Seminar are required to complete a replacement course designated by the Registrar the following term. The completion of this Spring Term course makes it possible for the student to fulfill the FYS graduation requirement. For students who fail the Fall Term First-Year Seminar, successful completion of the Spring Term course also allows the grade in the FYS to be changed from “F” to “NP” on the transcript.\nStudents who begin their college enrollment in the Spring Term must also complete a course designated as a replacement."

    "text": "Writing Across the Curriculum: Statement of Guiding Principles\nAs stated in the Coe College Mission Statement, our reason to exist as an institution is to ready students intellectually, professionally, and socially to lead productive and satisfying lives in the global society of the 21st century. In accordance with this mission, our curriculum requires that students undertake “a series of intensive writing experiences, spread across four years of study.” This requirement is known as Writing Across the Curriculum, the guiding principles of which are detailed below.\nAs a philosophy, Writing Across the Curriculum asserts that writing is most effectively learned in context: to varied audiences, with varied purposes. In adopting this philosophy, Coe College has committed to making writing-intensive experiences available to students in all disciplines. Known as “Writing Emphasis” credits, these courses are divergent in subject matter but aligned in their commitment to giving students content-rich and context-specific writing experiences that foster a critical flexibility in transferring knowledge about effective writing to multiple, even unknown, contexts.\nTherefore, students who complete the requisite number of writing emphasis courses will graduate from Coe knowing that writing is both a means and an end: a method for exploring ideas and deepening one’s knowledge as well as a tool for sharing that knowledge and expressing one’s point of view. Similarly, graduating students will know that the practice of writing is a recursive process rooted in revision, which refers both to the reconsideration of one’s ideas and to the refinement of prose, and this process unfolds over a lifetime. Understanding that students will encounter innumerable writing situations in their lives, many of which may be unfamiliar to them, they will graduate from Coe having developed the confidence and self-efficacy necessary to adapt or draw from their existing knowledge in order to navigate new contexts.\nAlthough many courses at Coe may include writing activities, courses endorsed by Writing Across the Curriculum are those in which: - Students are given opportunities to practice revision, whether via multiple drafts of a single project or multiple iterations of the same type of assignment; - Students receive instructor feedback on written work to facilitate revision; and - Writing assignments are frequent enough that they are integral to the learning throughout the course, enabling students to develop in one or more of the following learning outcomes, as appropriate to discipline and course objectives: - How to write for specific purposes and audiences - Including attention to the ways purposes and audiences shape form, mode, voice, method, organization, engagement with and citation of research, and/or creativity and imagination - How to engage in critical thinking - Particularly how to conduct analysis, how to synthesize information, how to interpret and/or use evidence and data, and how to present one’s ideas coherently and stylistically - How to practice, assess, and develop effective habits for writing - Specifically, how to read deeply, how to begin and later practice selection in research, how to be a skilled reader of one’s own and others’ in-process writing, how to accept and interpret feedback, and how to revise writing, all of which are parts of the process of learning how to have and develop ideas - How to engage in writing as a method for learning and discovery - For deepening knowledge, thinking through questions and problems, and reflecting on connections and growth - How to name and describe one’s own knowledge for others - For example, in the form of personal statements for application to graduate study, cover letters and resumes for entering and advancing in the workforce, or other forms of self-summary that facilitate transition from the baccalaureate environment through the broader public.\nMany writing emphasis sections are offered each year, and, in addition, the College’s rhetoric department offers several interdisciplinary writing courses designed to guide students learning to write effectively at the college level. (See course descriptions starting on p. 70). General Education or major courses that are also designated as writing emphasis courses may be used to satisfy both requirements.\nIn this catalog, writing emphasis courses are designated by a (WE) after the course title, e.g. “RHE-200 Rhetorical Theory & Practice (WE).” In other contexts, the course code may end with a “W” (e.g. RHE-200-W). All sections of such a course, regardless of instructor, will carry writing emphasis credit.\nFulfilling the Writing Emphasis Requirement:\nOnly designated WE courses in which a student earns a grade of “C” (2.0) or better count toward fulfillment of this requirement.\nOnly designated courses taken at Coe College count toward fulfillment of this requirement.\nUndergraduate degree-seeking* students - who start at Coe College or who transfer fewer than 8 course credits earned after graduation from high school must complete at least 5 writing emphasis courses. Of these 5, one will usually be the FYS. Of the remaining 4, it is recommended (but not required) that at least 1 be taken outside the student’s intended major(s). - who transfer at least 8 but fewer than 16 course credits to Coe, earned after graduation from high school, must complete at least 3 writing emphasis courses. - who transfer 16 or more course credits to Coe, earned after graduation from high school, must complete at least 2 writing emphasis credits. For all students, regardless of transfer credit, it is recommended (but not required) that at least one writing emphasis course be taken in the upper division within the student’s intended major(s). “Upper division” courses are defined in this case as those numbered 300 and above; upper division writing emphasis courses could include both scheduled classroom courses and arranged writing-based capstone projects (such as a thesis). See Departmental Writing Plans for more information on writing in the major(s). *Students seeking a second undergraduate degree from Coe should see Second Baccalaureate Degree p. 16.\n\n11.0.0.1 COURSE NUMBERING\n\nCourses numbered 100–199 are introductory to the subject.\nCourses numbered 200–299 assume a capacity for the independent acquisition of material and generally build on the methods and subject matter of 100-level courses.\nCourses numbered 300–399 are typically oriented toward a major or minor. They require a strong foundation of knowledge specific to the discipline.\nCourses numbered 400–499 are courses in the major or minor that are designed to challenge students to integrate discipline-specific knowledge in advanced ways. These courses typically contain advanced disciplinary coursework, capstone projects, and/or independent research."

At the end of their fourth year of study, students in the program will receive their bachelor’s degree from Coe College, while also having a year of law school completed at the University of Iowa College of Law.\nThere is no prescribed curriculum for students intending to enter law school after graduation. Law schools report that their most successful students are those who have acquired a broad academic background in the liberal arts, developed a capacity for logical analysis, and mastered the ability to write clearly.\nStudy in one or several of a variety of disciplines will prepare students to undertake legal training. Students interested in law should consult their department advisor and the pre-law program director.\n\n\n13.5.2 Health Professions\nStorer (Program Director).\nCoe’s program for those interested in the health professions, such as medicine and dentistry, is a flexible one based on the requirements of the health professions’ schools.

    "text": "15.0.1 Libraries\nThe College libraries—Stewart Memorial Library, located at the center of the campus and Fisher Music Library in Marquis Hall—contain over 500,000 volumes and 16,000 pieces of media. Current subscriptions to some 3,500 periodicals and serials are maintained in print or electronic format, and over 200,000 electronic resources with books and journal volumes added annually.\nThe collections ably support undergraduate education and are especially strong in the areas of literature, history, and music. The Fisher Music Library contains over 5,000 compact discs and records, 5,300 scores and books, and is equipped with listening facilities. Media services to the campus are provided through the Media Technologies Department in the library. These services include a circulating collection of over 8,000 DVDs, two media-equipped auditorium styled classrooms, editing stations, an innovation studio that houses a 3D printer and laser cutter, and a variety of cameras, recording equipment available for use.\nThe main library houses the Learning Commons (see description below) and the college archives. The library provides an outstanding research collection consisting of both print and electronic books, journals, and reference resources. The Reference Department assists students with their research needs through one on one research assistance, evaluating resources and websites, citation assistance and multimedia evaluation. In addition to library orientations, research classes are offered on specific course related topics. The library offers computer stations, iPad and laptop checkouts, study areas for individual and group study, including technology enhanced study rooms. These resources are greatly augmented by providing access to over 100 scholarly databases and an extensive webpage: coe.edu/library.\nThe George T. Henry College Archives includes a research room and a climate-controlled vault located on the lower level of the Stewart Memorial Library. It houses and preserves the institutional records of Coe College and the papers of staff, students, and alumni of the college. Archive staff is available to aid students, faculty, and scholars in navigation and use of more than 900 linear feet of primary source documents. The Archives maintains the papers of journalist, author, and World War II broadcaster William L. Shirer, Coe class of 1925 author of The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich; the literary works and selected private papers of Iowa poet Paul Engle, Coe class of 1931; and the photographs of longtime Coe College photographer George T. Henry.\n\n\n15.0.2 Learning Commons\nThe Coe Learning Commons in the Stewart Memorial Library integrates all of the College’s academic support resources in a single location at the heart of campus delivered through peer education and by professional staff. Services and resources include academic coaching, supplemental advising, Writing Center, AAP-TRIO program, tutoring, accessibility support and accommodations, academic technology, Office of Off-Campus Study, and fellowship and graduate school advising.\n\n\n15.0.3 Art Collections\nSelections from the College’s Permanent Collection of Art totaling over 800 works by 200 artists are displayed in and near many of the campus buildings. Most visible are the large outdoor sculptures on the campus, yet almost every building features selections from the Permanent Collection.  For example, the Ella Poe Burling collection of nineteenth-century American and French art and antiques is exhibited in the upper lobby of Voorhees Hall.\nA large portion of the Permanent Collection can be found in Stewart Memorial Library.  Four special galleries contain works by renowned American painters Grant Wood, Marvin Cone (Coe class of 1914), and Conger Metcalf (Coe class of 1936). Six large farm murals by Grant Wood constitute the heart of the Permanent Collection’s Regionalist works. These murals are supplemented by nine smaller yet significant works by Wood, including Daughters of Revolution, a charcoal, pastel, and pencil on paper drawing of Wood’s painting of the same name.\nAnother signature feature of the Regionalist collection is the work of Marvin Cone. A 1914 Coe graduate, Cone later became a faculty member who founded the College’s Art Department. Cone personally selected many of the paintings and drawings in the collection as representative of his own artistic development, underscoring the historic role of art as a core element in Coe’s teaching mission.\nIn addition to the works by native Iowans Cone and Wood, Coe College has acquired a distinguished collection of 70 works by Conger Metcalf, an American modernist painter, as well as paintings, drawings, and prints by notable artists such as Milton Avery, Mauricio Lasansky, Henri Matisse, Pablo Picasso, and Andy Warhol.\nMore information about the Permanent Collection can be found on either the Permanent Collection’s website, http://picovado.com/jrogers/#-h2-introduction-h2-, or the library’s webpage, www.coe.edu/academics/stewart-memorial-library.\n\n\n15.0.4 Information Technology\nThe Information Technology Office provides a wide range of technology support to students, faculty and staff. This includes management of computer labs, classroom technology, college-wide software licensing, wi-fi/internet, printers, cable TV, sound equipment, My Coe (my.coe.edu) and more. Coe’s technology facilities include over 3,000 ethernet ports, full ethernet and wi-fi internet services within all campus buildings, 250 public/lab computers available for student use and full access to G-Suite services. The Office of Information Technology is located in Voorhees Hall. Assistance from the IT staff can be requested through a Help Desk/Spiceworks ticket (link found on my.coe.edu). \n\n\n15.0.5 Public Events and Artists-in-Residence\nGuest lecturers and artists provide an essential dynamism to the educational climate at Coe. Programs are free to Coe students. In addition to hearing speakers of national and international note, students may have the opportunity to talk with them during a carry tray lunch, to attend special issues dinners with the speakers, or to have them as guests in a class. Performing groups appearing as artists-in-residence often stay two or three days on campus to work with students.\n\n15.0.5.1 Marquis Lecture & Performance Series\nThe Marquis Lecture & Performance Series hosts performances and presentations throughout the academic year. The Marquis Series is endowed by a gift from Sarah Marquis, Coe class of 1918, in honor of her father, John A. Marquis, who was president of Coe from 1909 to 1919.\n\n\n15.0.5.2 Coe College Contemporary Issues Forum\nThe Coe College Contemporary Issues Forum brings to audiences of the College community the presence and\nviews of distinguished professionals whose work has received national recognition. The forum is normally presented during the month of February.\n\n\n15.0.5.3 Phi Beta Kappa Visiting Scholar\nThe Coe chapter of Phi Beta Kappa sponsors a Phi Beta Kappa Visiting Scholar who, in addition to presenting a public lecture, meets with individual classes as appropriate to the scholar’s area of expertise."

    "title": "16  STUDENT LIFE",
    "section": "16.1 Student Services",
    "text": "16.1 Student Services\n\n16.1.1 Residence Life\nCoe is a residential college, in that the residence experience is an integral part of the educational process. Students are expected to live on campus for four years and take meals in the College hall (see On-Campus and Off-Campus Resident Students, p. 263). The residence halls and apartments vary in style, size, and personality. All of the residential facilities have generous visitation policies, and campus life functions around the concept of the living units.\nResidence hall and apartment regulations are published in the Student Reference Book. As room charges do not include Winter Break or Spring Break, when residential facilities and the dining hall are closed, an additional fee is assessed to students staying on campus during those times. Information regarding housing is sent to students who have accepted admission to the College.\n\n\n16.1.2 Student Health Service\nCoe’s Student Health Service offers students medical care provided by a part-time Advanced Registered Nurse Practitioner (ARNP) and a full-time nurse. The Health Services staff can diagnose, manage, and treat certain medical diagnoses, free to full-time Coe students. Referrals are available to a family physician or specialist in the Cedar Rapids community as needed. In the event that a student needs hospitalization, St. Luke’s Hospital or Mercy Medical Center is utilized. The student is responsible for all health costs beyond those provided by Health Services. These include hospitalizations, emergency room visits, physician visits, and prescription medications. Therefore, all students are expected to carry medical insurance. Provisions for special diets or other arrangements which deviate from Coe’s policies require a recommendation from the student’s healthcare provider and are available through SODEXO food services. All students are required to have a current immunization record on file prior to registration for classes at Coe. Students without immunizations on file will have their registration held. Students who wish to utilize the Student Health Service should have a physical on file, which is required of all students in order to play collegiate sports.\n\n\n16.1.3 Personal Counseling\nRealizing that students have concerns in areas other than academic matters and career options, Coe provides appropriate individual and group counseling. St. Luke’s Family Counseling Center, located next to the Coe campus, and the College work together to provide for students’ counseling needs. St. Luke’s Family Counseling Center provides assessment, short-term counseling, and, when appropriate, referral to community resources. Individual counseling is available from a number of counselors on an appointment basis for students with personal, social, and family concerns. In addition, students may seek counseling from a pastoral and spiritual perspective from the College Chaplain. If long-term counseling is needed, Coe’s counselor and Chaplain work with students to identify cost-effective solutions on and off campus.\n\n\n16.1.4 Religious Life\nCoe College believes that it is important to foster an environment that accepts and respects the religious faith and beliefs of all its students, staff, and faculty. The Coe community is diverse in its religious makeup, and all members of the community are encouraged to express and practice their particular religious traditions. To this end, the College Chaplain seeks to provide and create an atmosphere that is consistent with the religious heritage of the College and conducive to the development of spiritual and moral values.\nOpportunities for worship, interfaith dialogue, Bible study, retreat, small groups, theological study, outreach, mission, meditation, and fellowship are abundant. There are also several active religious student organizations on campus and a specialized leadership program for students considering vocational ministry. The Chaplain is available for pastoral care, guided prayer, theological dialogue, pre-marital counseling, and other spiritual needs.\n\n\n16.1.5 Diversity, Equity & Inclusion\nThe Office of Diversity, Equity & Inclusion is comprised of the Dean of Students, Coordinator of Multicultural Affairs, Director of International Affairs, and the College Chaplain. This team works closely with LBGTQAI+ students, multicultural students, international students, and student allies, with the goal of fostering an environment where all Kohawks will thrive in an inclusive learning environment. Students interested in getting involved with Coe’s diversity and inclusion efforts are encouraged to stop by the Student Life Office in Upper Gage and speak with a team member.\n\n\n16.1.6 Campus Activities\nThere is much to do on the Coe campus and in the Cedar Rapids community. Programming of campus activities is designed to meet the educational and recreational needs of the Coe community in a creative way. The diversity of the student body is considered in the scheduling of recitals, plays, exhibits, lectures, films, and concerts, as well as all school events and relaxing evenings in Charlie’s. The Director of Campus Life coordinates the events organized by the Student Activities Committee (SAC).\n\n\n16.1.7 Student Activity Groups\nStudents earn credit for their participation in Coe’s music ensembles (the Jazz and Concert Bands, the Symphony Orchestra, the Concert Choir, Chorale, and the Choral Chamber Ensemble), several of which have completed study/concert tours of Europe, Great Britain, and Asia in the past. Coe drama and forensics activities have received local and national recognition for their presentations. Special interest organizations are also represented on campus, as are national social fraternities and sororities and honor societies (Phi Beta Kappa, Phi Kappa Phi, Mortar Board, Alpha Lambda Delta, and Alpha Sigma Lambda).\n\n\n16.1.8 Athletics\nCoe College sponsors 11 men’s and 11 women’s athletic teams that compete in the American Rivers Conference of NCAA Division III. Our goal is to provide our student athletes with positive educational and athletic experiences.\nThrough hard work, intense training, and positive interactions with coaches, student athletes are provided opportunities to succeed. The College recognizes that many of its students enjoy participating in organized athletics or watching athletic contests as forms of recreational campus life. Basketball, volleyball, softball, table tennis, flag football, and wrestling are representative events in a year-round intramural program for both men and women. All students are eligible to participate.\n\n\n16.1.9 Recreational Facilities\nGage Memorial Union is the center of student interest and activity. Offices of the Student Activities Committee and other student organizations are there, plus the College dining hall, and mailroom. Informal programs and lectures are given there, and it serves as the College’s “open house” for students, faculty, and visitors. “Charlie’s,” located in the adjacent P.U.B., is home to a coffee shop (serving Starbucks coffee), a convenience store, and grill. Charlie’s is a relaxing place to meet friends or take in one of the many performances.\nThe brand-new Coe College Athletics and Recreation Center includes two pristine courts for basketball and volleyball, a wrestling room that boasts three oversized mats, strength and conditioning room with brand-new equipment, and a fitness center that overlooks the campus. This is where Coe’s basketball, volleyball, and wrestling teams host their home events.\nMoray Eby Fieldhouse includes three recently-renovated courts for basketball and volleyball. Eby also has a natatorium, athletic training rooms, indoor baseball/softball batting cages, and a rock-climbing wall. All outside playing fields and tennis courts are also available to Coe students.\nThe Clark Racquet Center offers a state-of-the-art facility for runners, racquet enthusiasts, and everyone wanting to stay in shape. An aerobic room, dance studio, and classrooms complement the indoor track, tennis courts, and racquetball and squash courts. Professional staff manage the center and offer instruction to students."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Students ordinarily are graduated under the provisions of the catalog of their matriculation date. A student’s matriculation date is the day of first enrollment following admission. If the student is readmitted, the matriculation date becomes the day of first enrollment following readmission. However, students will be expected to satisfy, to the extent practical, the graduation requirements of the catalog in effect at the anticipated date of graduation. Any necessary modification of general degree requirements will be worked out by the Provost and Dean of the Faculty, the Registrar, the appropriate department chair, and the Academic Policies Committee. Modification of major or minor requirements will be worked out by the department chair involved, the Registrar, and the student’s advisor. A student has the right of petition to the Committee on Petitions.\n\n17.0.1 Grading\nGRADES | | | | |—-|———————————–|————————————| | A | Excellent | 4.0 grade points per course credit | | A- | | 3.7 grade points per course credit | | B+ | | 3.3 grade points per course credit | | B | Above average | 3.0 grade points per course credit | | B- | | 2.7 grade points per course credit | | C+ | | 2.3 grade points per course credit | | C | Satisfactory, minimum expectation | 2.0 grade points per course credit | | | credit | | | C- | | 1.7 grade points per course credit | | D+ | | 1.3 grade points per course credit | | D | Passing, below expectation | 1.0 grade points per course credit | | D- | | 0.7 grade points per course credit |\n\n\n17.0.2 Status Marks\n\nW Approved withdrawal from a course.\nX Course extends beyond term. An “X” status grade is given in courses designated in the Catalog as having course work that extends beyond the end of the term. Under no circumstances can an “X” grade remain unresolved for more than one calendar year.\nO No mark had been reported by the instructor by the time academic reports were processed.\nI Incomplete. An “I” status grade is reported only for students who are unable to complete the work in the course due to extenuating circumstances. The normal length of time for resolution of an incomplete is within four weeks of the next Fall or Spring term in which the student enrolls. If the instructor believes the resolution of the incomplete will take longer, the instructor will note the later deadline when reporting the incomplete status grade. An unresolved incomplete will automatically become a failing grade after the deadline, unless the instructor notes otherwise when reporting the incomplete. Under no circumstances can an “I” grade remain unresolved for more than one calendar year.\nR The prefix “R” to a grade (i.e., RA, RB, RC, RD, RF) indicates a grade of repeated course. A student may repeat a course previously taken, and registration must indicate this repeat. Failure to register for a repeat course properly results in no recognition of the second attempt. Only the grade earned when the course is retaken is used in computing the GPA. Credit may be earned only once for a given course. Courses may be repeated only once, although, students may petition for a second repeat if extenuating circumstances exist.\nEQ Equivalent credit recognized; no credit given. Does not increase courses attempted. For a student who has completed four course credits of student teaching and who has high school or life experience equivalent to a regular catalog course, the said course, upon recommendation of the Education chair and the chair of the department in which equivalent credit is being recognized, may be listed on the student’s transcript with the appropriate credit and a status mark of “EQ.”\n\n\n\n17.0.3 Audited Courses\nStudents may audit courses with the consent of the instructor. In doing so, they attend class but are not required to take tests or submit papers. Audited courses receive no credit and do not appear on transcripts. Auditors pay a reduced tuition charge.\n\n\n17.0.4 First Course Grading For Non-Traditional Students\nIndividuals who have been away from the collegiate routine for several years may register on an audit basis in their first course, participate fully in the class (including tests, papers, etc.), and decide at the conclusion of the course if they wish to pay the other half of the tuition and receive credit for the course. This policy applies only to the first course—not to succeeding courses.\n\n\n17.0.5 Pass / Not-Pass Graded Courses\nCourses are graded A–F unless otherwise indicated in the course description that only P/NP is an option (e.g., student teaching, internships). Courses graded P/NP count as credits towards graduation but do not affect the student’s GPA. In addition, students may opt to take up to four A–F graded courses on a P/NP basis. When students opt for P/NP grading, the Office of the Registrar converts any grade a faculty member provides of D- or better to a P, and any grade of F to an NP. In order to count for Writing Emphasis credit, a submitted grade of C or higher must be earned.\nThe following regulations apply:\n\nStudents are permitted to change the method of grading for a course from a letter grade to P/NP. This change is allowed from the start of the term of enrollment through the last day to withdraw from courses during that term. See Academic Calendar p. 12 for official dates.\nStudents may elect to take up to four graded courses during their undergraduate career on a P/NP basis. However:\n\nStudents cannot use a course for which they elected P/NP grading to satisfy the requirements for a major or minor.\nStudents cannot elect P/NP grading while on academic probation, though provisionally-admitted First Year students are allowed the option of P/NP grading.\n\nThe Registrar will not inform the instructor of the student’s request for P/NP grading and the instructor must provide the Registrar with an appropriate letter grade.\nA student’s request for P/NP grading may be nullified at any time before the end of the third business day after grades are due in the student’s final term. A written notice must be sent to the Office of the Registrar to communicate the student’s intent to replace the P or NP grade with the instructor’s letter grade.\nA student’s request to change their method of grading to P/NP in lieu of a letter grade counts as one of the four P/NP elected courses during the student’s undergraduate career, regardless of whether it is later nullified.\nOrdinarily a student is limited to one course credit per term on an elected P/NP basis. A student wishing to exceed this limitation must present a convincing rationale or significant mitigating circumstances to the Committee on Petitions.\n\n\n\n17.0.6 Midterm Grades\nMidterm grades are not official evaluations and are not part of the official transcript. The goal of midterm grades is to help students take responsibility for their academic progress. Faculty submit midterm grades of A-F for students in all full-term courses. Midterm grades are not intended to be a guarantee, promise, or contract regarding the final grade a student will earn in the class. Instead they provide information for students about their academic performance."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Before being allowed to register, students must have been admitted for study by the Office of Admission, must have settled their account with the Business Office, and must meet with their Academic Advisor. Registrations are canceled for failure to pay fees on time.\nStudents are encouraged to develop a four-year comprehensive educational plan with the help of their advisor or with other members of the faculty.\nStudents who will not graduate during the current academic year register online during the Spring Term for the Fall Term of the following academic year during times specified by the Office of the Registrar. Registration for the Spring and May Terms takes place during the preceding Fall Term. Once the online registration period is over, all changes to registration must take place in the Office of the Registrar using accurate, legible, and completed registration forms. Entering first-year students and transfer students receive instructions with their orientation materials, and readmitted students receive instructions from the Office of the Registrar concerning their registrations. Registrations are not accepted for a term without successful petition after the end of the first week of classes of that term.\n\n19.0.1 Changes in Registration\n\nUnless a course is registered by a student online during the registration period, they must intentionally file a registration form with the Office of the Registrar in order to be registered for a course. Registration forms for course additions must be approved by the student’s advisor and instructor of the course.\nCourses may be added or dropped during the first five weeks of the Fall, Spring, or Summer Term, including 7-week courses. Students may add a May Term course during the first three days of the term. If a student needs to add a course after these deadlines due to extenuating circumstances, the student must petition the Committee on Petitions by completing the appropriate forms.\n\nFor courses spanning a fraction of a Term, the last date to add or drop without a “W” will be calculated as a proportionate time frame comparatively as full-term courses. See Academic Calendar (see p. 12) for official dates for full-term and half-term courses. 3. A student may withdraw from one or more courses with the following results: - If a student withdraws from a course when 2/3 or less of the Term is completed, a “W” (withdrawal) grade will be entered on the student’s permanent record. This grade will not affect the student’s GPA. This is the date listed in the academic calendar as the Last Day to Withdraw from a course.\n- For courses spanning a fraction of a Term, the last date to withdraw with a “W” will be calculated using the 2/3 fraction. See Academic Calendar (p. 15) for official dates for full-term and half-term courses. - If a student officially withdraws from a course after 2/3 of the Term is completed, a “WF” will be entered on the student’s permanent record. This will affect the student’s GPA (see p. 53). - A withdrawn course, regardless of the date withdrawn, counts as attempted credits on the transcript. Therefore, it also counts when calculating academic standing (see p. 61), and satisfactory academic progress (see p. 275) for financial aid.\n\n\n19.0.2 Course Load\nA student is full-time for the Fall or Spring Term when enrolled for three or more course credits. A student enrolled for less than this course load is a part-time student. For financial aid purposes, half-time is defined as enrollment in no fewer than two course credits in each of the Fall and Spring Terms; three-fourths is defined as enrollment in no fewer than 2.5 course credits in each of the Fall and Spring Terms. Students who have earned a cumulative GPA of 3.4 or above, or have earned both 23 credits and a cumulative GPA of 2.5 or above, may take above 4.99 credits without the need for a petition, but approval must be secured from the Office of the Registrar. Other students must submit a petition to the Committee on Petitions and obtain approval in order to register for five or more course credits. No student shall be permitted to register for over 5.99 credits in each of the Fall and Spring Terms. Only petitions from those students who have completed at least one term as a full-time student will be considered by the Committee on Petitions. Students may not register for more than one course credit during May Term."

    "title": "20  ACADEMIC INTEGRITY POLICY",
    "section": "",
    "text": "At Coe College, we expect academic integrity of all members of our community. Academic integrity assumes honesty about the nature of one’s work in all situations. Such honesty is at the heart of the educational enterprise and is a precondition for intellectual growth. Academic dishonesty is the willful attempt to misrepresent one’s work, cheat, plagiarize, or impede other students’ academic progress. Academic dishonesty interferes with the mission of the College and will be treated with the utmost seriousness as a violation of community standards.\n\n20.0.1 Forms of Academic Dishonesty\nCheating is the attempt to deceive an evaluator by claiming credit for work one has not done or by knowingly assisting such an attempt. It includes (but is not limited to) the use of unauthorized sources of information on in-class or take-home exams, or other assignments; copying from other students on exams, assignments, or lab reports; fabrication of data, research, quotations, or other information; and taking credit for collaborations to which one has not contributed.\nPlagiarism is the use of someone else’s words or ideas without acknowledgement and, when intentional, is a form of academic dishonesty. The unacknowledged use of words or ideas from any published or unpublished sources, including Internet resources or other student papers, constitutes plagiarism. Plagiarism may occur intentionally or unintentionally through the omission of appropriate citations. Any ideas or information the student adopts from a source, whether or not directly quoted, must be acknowledged by specific reference in notes or the text.\nAny words or phrases that are taken from a source must be quoted and cited. Any paraphrase—the restatement of an idea in your own words—must be cited.\nThe methods of citation and documentation vary from discipline to discipline. Students are responsible for determining the appropriate method for any given assignment or, in the absence of a clearly stated protocol, using any accepted academic method. Guidelines can be found on the library website and in the Writing Center.\nOther forms of academic dishonesty include (but are not limited to) deliberately impeding other students’ work and misuse of common academic property, in the libraries, labs, and elsewhere.\n\n\n20.0.2 Sanctions\nInstructors have responsibility for determining whether academic dishonesty has occurred. Instructors shall proceed with sanctions accordingly. Any act of academic dishonesty that results in one of the sanctions below shall be detailed in a formal report filed with the Provost and Dean of the Faculty.\nCases of unintentional plagiarism may be dealt with through educational procedures such as further assignments requiring the student to practice documentation and citation methods, or other means determined by the instructor.\nActs of academic dishonesty will be subject to one or more of the following sanctions:\n\nfailure of the assignment, i.e. exam, paper, lab report, etc.\nfailure of the class\nsuspension or expulsion\n\nAn instructor may impose the first two of these penalties. Suspension or expulsion may only be carried out by the Provost and Dean of the Faculty.\nRepeated acts of academic dishonesty will result in suspension or expulsion. When academic dishonesty has been determined to have occurred a second time, the Provost and Dean of the Faculty shall decide on the student’s status at the College.\n\n\n20.0.3 Procedure\nWhen an instance of academic dishonesty is suspected, the instructor will meet with the student to discuss the incident and will decide which, if any, of the above sanctions is appropriate.\nIf warranted, the instructor will send a report to the Provost, with a copy given to the student, which details the nature of the violation and the steps taken to address it. The Provost will send a letter to the student within ten business days of receipt of the faculty member’s report. The letter will reiterate the incident, describe the sanctions, and inform the student of their right to appeal. The report and letter from the Provost will remain on file in the Academic Affairs Office until five years after the student’s graduation or severance from Coe. The Vice President for Student Life will be notified that a report has been filed. Information in the file will be confidential, to be shared only at the discretion of the Provost and Dean of the Faculty for a legitimate educational or legal purpose.\n\n\n20.0.4 Appeals Process\nThe student may appeal the charge and/or the sanction within ten business days of receiving the Provost’s letter of notice by emailing the Provost and Dean of the Faculty requesting an appeals hearing. Students wishing to appeal are strongly encouraged to consult with the Director of Academic Achievement, who has been designated by the College to provide information and advocacy in these matters.\nThe Provost’s Office will convene an Academic Integrity Appeals Board within ten business days of receipt of the request for appeal to hear the appeal. The Academic Integrity Appeals Board will be chaired by either the chair or co-chair of the Academic Policies Committee. Additional members of the board will include: one additional faculty member on the Academic Policies Committee, the senior Student Life officer, one faculty member from the Committee on Admission, Retention, and Enrollment, and the Associate Dean for Student Academics.  In any hearing the Provost may replace the Associate Dean for Student Success, or other member of the board to avoid conflicts of interest. The student may choose to have a faculty or staff member present as an observer. The student and the instructor will each appear as witnesses and each may request that other pertinent witnesses appear.\nA majority vote of the Appeals Board is necessary to uphold or overturn a sanction. If a sanction is overturned, the Appeals Board may impose a lesser sanction. The Appeals Board will submit a written finding which will be sent to the student and the faculty member(s) involved in the case and which will become part of the student’s file. If the appeal’s outcome is to overturn the dishonesty charge, the report in the Academic Affairs Integrity file will be removed."

If the records are not maintained by the Office of the Registrar, the Registrar shall advise the student of the correct official to whom the request should be addressed.\nthe right to request the amendment of the student’s education records that the student believes are inaccurate or misleading. Students may ask the College to amend records that they believe are inaccurate or misleading. They should write the College official responsible for the records, clearly identify the part of the record they want changed, and specify why it is inaccurate or misleading. FERPA was not intended to provide a process to be used to question substantive judgments which are correctly recorded. The rights of challenge are not intended to allow students to contest, for example, a grade in a course because they felt a higher grade should have been assigned. If the College decides not to amend the record as requested by the student, the College will notify the student of the decision and advise the student of his or her right to a hearing regarding the request for amendment. Additional information regarding the hearing procedures will be provided to the student when notified of the right to a hearing.\nthe right to consent to disclosures of personally identifiable information contained in the student’s education records, except to the extent that FERPA authorized disclosure without consent. One exception which permits disclosure without consent is disclosure to school officials with legitimate educational interests. A school official is a person employed by the College in an administrative, supervisory, academic or research, or support staff position (including law enforcement unit personnel and health staff); a person or company with whom the College has contracted (such as an attorney, auditor, collection agent, or official of the National Student Clearinghouse); or a student serving on an official committee, such as an admission, petitions, retention, honors recognition, disciplinary, or grievance committee, or assisting another school official in performing his or her tasks. A school official has a legitimate educational interest if the official needs to review an education record in order to fulfill his or her professional responsibility.\nthe right to file a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education concerning alleged failures by the College to comply with the requirements of FERPA.\n\nA student is a person who attends or has attended Coe College, as determined by matriculation and enrollment by the first date of an academic term. Coe College obtains written permission from the student before releasing any information from a student’s educational record in most cases. However, as the law allows, on a case-by-case basis, appropriate parts of a student record may be disclosed, without consent of the student, to the following parties:\n\ncollege employees who have a legitimate need to know.\npersons who need to know in cases of health and safety emergencies.\naccrediting organizations to carry out accrediting functions.\nappropriate parties in connection with financial aid to a student.\nfederal, state, and local governmental officials for purposes authorized by law.\nindividuals who have lawfully obtained court orders or subpoenas.\norganizations conducting educational studies for the College.\ncourts during litigation between the College and the student or parent.\nvictim of crime of violence after final results of a disciplinary hearing.\npublic after disciplinary proceedings determine student committed crime of violence.\n\nIn many situations, complaints relative to FERPA can be resolved with the College on an informal basis by contacting the Registrar, in the lower level of Voorhees Hall.\nTo file a FERPA complaint with the U.S. Department of Education, contact the office that administers FERPA at: Family Policy Compliance Office, U.S. Dept. of Education, 400 Maryland Avenue SW, Washington, DC 20202-4605."

Students who are taking fewer than three credits are considered part-time.\nPart-time students may not participate in the complete program of College activities unless they pay the activity fee. A part-time student cannot be an on-campus resident student, unless special written permission has been granted by the Office of Residence Life.\n\n\n26.1.2 Enrollment Fee\nA $300 non-refundable enrollment fee is paid to the College by the accepted candidate.\n\n\n26.1.3 Comprehensive Fee\nCoe College charges tuition, room, board, and student fees. The student fees include Health Services and an Activity Fee which is allocated to the Student Senate for apportionment among various student activities such as the student newspaper, literary magazine, and social events.

Such experiences occur best when students are living and learning full-time on campus. The residential life program is an integral part of the education program and support services at Coe College. Residence halls and hall staff provide a structure by which the experience of the classroom is joined with the out-of-class learning experience of the student.\nFull-time students are required to live in residence and take meals in the college dining hall and, thereby, are charged for room and board unless exempt for one or more of the following reasons: 1. Married students – must provide copy of signed marriage license 2. Live with parent(s)/guardian(s) within 25 miles of campus (address on file with College is verified) 3. Dependent child (person must provide copy of child’s birth certificate) 4. Completed 8 semesters living on campus 5. Students who are 25 years or older.\nOther exceptions to the residence requirement must be applied for in writing to the Dean of Students. Approval or denial is determined on a case-by-case basis following evaluation of the extenuating circumstances provided for review. Students are notified in writing of the decision. Permission to live off campus must be on file in the Residence Life Office and must be renewed each year. Students who violate the residence requirement are charged full room and board costs for the entire year. Coe funded scholarships and grants will typically be reduced by approximately 10 percent when a student moves off campus.\n\n\n26.1.5 ACM and Other Off-Campus Study Programs\nStudents desiring to study off-campus must first obtain approval from the Director of Off-Campus study. In every case, students are responsible for their own transportation and living expenses. Each student is advised to check with the program’s director as to the cost (and other details) of each program. This charge could vary significantly from the cost of remaining on campus. The tuition charged for Fall or Spring Term off-campus programs will be Coe’s tuition or the tuition for the off-campus program if greater than Coe’s tuition. In addition to tuition, Coe will charge the off-campus program fee as billed by the off-campus program. Students maintain their eligibility for federal and state financial aid; however, Coe financial aid availability is subject to approval by the Committee on Internationalization. Students registered for the optional May Term who desire to study off-campus (except Coe-sponsored programs) are billed a surcharge fee for tuition and/or program costs which are greater than 10% of Coe’s annual tuition. Tuition and fees for ACM off-campus study programs or study programs sponsored by other colleges must be paid in full prior to attending the off-campus program.\nNOTE: Students on regular-term Coe-administered programs including exchanges are able to use their Coe College gift aid to pay tuition that term. Domestic students on other providers’ programs may be able to utilize a portion of their Coe gift aid. International students may be able to utilize a portion of their Coe gift aid toward tuition for ACM or other providers’ domestic but not international programs. In all cases, students in an off-campus program are not charged the student-activity or health fee."

Federal regulations mandate that, a federal Title IV refund calculation, using the withdrawal date of either the midpoint of the term or the last date of attendance at a documented academically related activity, must be performed.\nA student’s withdrawal date is: The earlier of the date that the student began the official withdrawal process or otherwise provided official notification to a designated office of their intent to withdraw; OR If official notification could not be provided because of circumstances beyond the student’s control, the date the college determines is related to the particular circumstance; OR If the student ceased attendance without providing official notification, the midpoint of the term; OR The student’s last date of attendance at a documented academically related activity.\n\n\n26.4.3 Federal Title IV Refund Calculation/Policy\nIn accordance with federal regulations, a Title IV refund calculation must be performed for students that are recipients of Federal Student Aid (FSA) who cease attendance in all courses, including students who are expelled, or are granted a leave of absence. The FSA programs that are covered by this law are: Federal Pell Grants, TEACH Grants, Stafford Loans, PLUS Loans, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (FSEOG), Iraq Afghanistan Service Grant, and other Title IV Programs. The Coe College Student Financial Services Office determines, based on the federally mandated formula1, the amount of FSA assistance students have earned based on the date in the term a student is considered to be withdrawn. An example of the refund calculation is published online in the [Financial Aid Handbook] (https://www.coe.edu/admission/financial-aid-scholarships/financial-aid-handbook) and a handout may be obtained from the Student Financial Services Office.\n\n\n26.4.4 Return of Financial Aid Funds Policy Steps\n\nStep 1: Determine the percentage of enrollment period completed by the student. If the calculated percentage is equal to or greater than 60%, the student has “earned” all aid for the enrollment period and no adjustment in financial aid occurs.\nDays Attended ÷ Days in Enrollment Period = Percentage Completed\nStep 2: Apply the percentage completed to the Title IV aid award to determine the student’s eligibility for financial aid prior to the withdrawal.\n(Total Aid Disbursed + Aid that could have been disbursed) x Percentage Completed = Earned Aid\nStep 3: Determine the amount of unearned financial aid to be returned to the appropriate Title IV financial aid program.\nTotal Disbursed Aid – Earned Aid = Unearned Aid to be Returned\n\nIf the aid already disbursed equals the earned aid, no further action is required.\nIf the aid already disbursed is greater than the earned aid, the difference must be returned to the appropriate Title IV aid program.\nIf the aid already disbursed is less than the earned aid, a late disbursement may be made to the student.\n\nStep 4: Determine if the institution and/or the student must return the unearned funds.\n\nTotal Aid – Earned Aid = Unearned aid that must be returned\nUnearned Aid &gt; assessed charges = Unearned aid that must be returned by the student\nUnearned Aid ≤ assessed charges = Unearned aid to be returned by the College\n\n\nThe Coe College Student Financial Service Office is required to return any unearned FSA funds that were applied towards institutional charges within 45 days in the following order: + Direct Unsubsidized Stafford Loan + Direct (Subsidized) Stafford Loan + Direct Graduate PLUS Loan (for graduate students) + Direct PLUS Loan (for parents of undergraduate students) + Pell Grant + SEOG + TEACH Grant + Iraq Afghanistan Service Grant\nThe student will be informed by the Student Financial Services Office of the type and amount of FSA program funds that are being returned on their behalf and of the amount the student must return. If the student’s portion of aid to be returned is a loan, the terms of the original loan repayment agreement will apply. The amount of unearned grant funds a student must repay is limited to the amount by which unearned grant funds disbursed exceed half of the original grant award by $50 or more. In general, the Student Financial Services Office will return the grant funds to the appropriate federal program and charge the student’s Coe account, which will result in debt to the college.\n\nStep 5: Determine earned FSA assistance that has not been disbursed.\nTotal Aid Earned – Total Aid Disbursed = Earned Aid not Disbursed\n\nGrant aid that was earned, but had not been applied before the student withdrew, will be applied to the students account within 45 days. Loan proceeds that could be disbursed after the student withdrew will only be disbursed if the student requests a disbursement within 14 days of receiving notice from the Student Financial Services of their eligibility of a post-withdrawal loan disbursement.\n\n\n26.4.5 Institutional Refund Calculation/Policy\nThe Student Financial Services will follow the federal Title IV Refund Calculation/ Policy in determining the amount of earned and unearned Coe scholarships and grants and state assistance.\nTuition, Board and Student Fees will be charged pro-rata based on the percentage of the enrollment period completed up to the 60-percentage point in time of the term. Room charge will not be refunded after Date of Record for the term. Please see the Coe Student Accounts Handbook to review the institutional refund policy for tuition, fees, room and board.\n\n\n26.4.6 May Term (optional)\nThe first May Term course taken by a student is a non-tuition charge term for all Coe full-time degree-seeking students enrolled in the Spring Term, therefore, no institutional aid is awarded to students. A $1000 fee per May Term course will be assessed for subsequent May Term courses taken by a student. Please see the Coe Student Accounts Handbook for more information about May Term.\n\n\n26.4.7 Enrollment Status Changes\nChanges in enrollment status from full-time to part-time may affect a student’s financial assistance. In general, the amount of financial aid a student is eligible to receive is based on the enrollment status as of the College’s official date of record. Federal direct loans will no longer be in an in-school deferment status for a student who drops below half-time at any time during the term Students should consult with the Student Financial Services to discuss how enrollment changes will affect their financial aid eligibility and loan deferment status.\n\n\n26.4.8 Part-Time Students\nA part-time student withdrawing from all courses in the Fall or Spring Terms shall be subject to Return of Title IV Funds/Institutional Refund Policy, see (federal-title-IV-refund-calculation-policy?) for more information.\n\n\n26.4.9 Summer Students\nA summer student withdrawing from class will be subject to Return of Title IV Funds/Institutional Refund Policy (see (federal-title-IV-refund-calculation-policy?) ) which credits earned aid and assessed charges on a prorated basis predicated on the term/session enrolled."
