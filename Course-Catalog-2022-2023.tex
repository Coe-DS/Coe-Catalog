\hypertarget{history-of-coe-college}{%
\subsection{HISTORY OF COE COLLEGE}\label{history-of-coe-college}}

Coe College claims the shortest name of any American institution of
higher education, but the school has actually carried five titles
through its history. When the Rev.~Williston Jones founded the college
in 1851, he called it The School for the Prophets. Cedar Rapids' first
resident minister opened the parlor of his home to a group of young men
with the goal of educating them for the ministry to serve churches in
the Midwest. Two years later, while Jones was canvassing churches in the
East for money to send three of his students to Eastern seminaries, a
Catskills farmer named Daniel Coe stepped forward with a pledge of
\$1,500 and urged Jones to start his own college in the frontier town of
Cedar Rapids. Legend has it that the \$1,500 raised by Coe was brought
west from New York, sewn into the petticoat of a lady visitor traveling
by stagecoach to Iowa. Coe gave this generous gift with the stipulation
that the proposed institute should be ``made available for the education
of females as well as males.'' Accordingly, Coe was coeducational from
its founding.

With Jones' blessing, the Cedar Rapids Collegiate Institute was
incorporated in 1853 by a group of Cedar Rapids leaders chaired by Judge
George Greene. They used Daniel Coe's money to purchase two downtown
lots for the school and 80 acres of farmland on what was then the edge
of town. The farm evolved into today's campus. In 1868, in a failed
attempt to secure the Lewis Parsons estate, the trustees renamed the
school Parsons Seminary. After a period of severe financial
difficulties, the institution was reestablished in honor of its original
benefactor as the Coe Collegiate Institute in 1875.

T.M Sinclair, founder of the Sinclair Meat Packing Company, played the
key financial role in the final step toward the firm establishment of
Coe College. Sinclair liquidated all the debt from Parsons Seminary and
the Cedar Rapids Collegiate Institute. The Sinclair gift made it
practical for the property of the Coe Collegiate Institute---including
the original land paid for by Daniel Coe---to be transferred to Coe
College with the Iowa Presbyterian Synod to assume major responsibility
for the institution. Coe College has operated continuously since its
incorporation under that name on Feb.~2, 1881. From the first, the
College was committed to intellectual excellence. It has continued in
this tradition ever since.

The compact campus on the east edge of Cedar Rapids grew with many
building projects in its early years, including Old Main (1868),
Williston Hall (1881), Marshall Hall (1900), the first gymnasium (1904),
and the first T.M. Sinclair Memorial Chapel (1911). In 1907, Coe earned
accreditation from the North Central Association of Colleges and
Universities. Over the decades, Coe's reputation as a superior liberal
arts college has continued to grow. One recognition of this came in
1949, when Coe was granted a Phi Beta Kappa chapter, a distinction
reserved for about 10\% of American colleges and universities.

Central to the educational philosophy of Coe College is the belief that
a liberal arts education is the best preparation for life. Students have
the opportunity to experience a variety of subjects outside their
respective programs of study. Coe offers more than 40 areas of study
that cover a range of fields. The College awards the following
undergraduate degrees: Bachelor of Arts (B.A.), Bachelor of Music
(B.M.), and Bachelor of Science in Nursing (B.S.N.).

There are a number of factors that contribute to Coe College's strong
academic quality. The key to Coe's tradition of excellence in academic
quality relates directly to small class sizes and the interest shown by
professors to make learning a personalized experience. At Coe, the
average class size is 16, and the student-faculty ratio is 11:1. Classes
are taught by our involved and committed faculty, 91\% of whom hold the
highest degree in their field. This means classes are taught by
experienced professionals who have in-depth knowledge of their subjects.
To provide students with a well-rounded experience and solid preparation
for the future, Coe offers, along with quality instruction from superb
faculty, an abundance of out-of-class opportunities which include
student-faculty collaborative research, honors projects, service
learning, and internships. Within one year of graduation, according to
the annual survey results from the Center for Creativity and Careers,
98\% of Coe graduates are engaged in post-graduate activity such as
employment, graduate school, military, or travel/adventure.

With the addition of the east campus, Coe has nearly doubled in size
since 1989. New facilities on the east side of College Drive include
Athletic Recreation Center (2017), Clark Racquet Center and athletic
fields (1989), Clark Alumni House (1993), Nassif House (1999), and four
student apartment buildings (Morris House and Schlarbaum House in 2000,
Brandt House and Spivey House in 2002). McCabe Hall (2005), named in
honor of former Coe President Joseph E. McCabe, houses the offices of
the president, provost, advancement and alumni relations, and The Center
for Creativity, Careers and Community (C3) making way for the remodeling
of Coe's oldest building, Stuart Hall, and the first significant
addition of classroom space since Peterson Hall was built in the 1960s.
In 2012 and 2013, Peterson Hall of Science was completely renovated to
support Coe's science programs. To further enhance the campus
environment, Coe completed the largest capital project in its history in
2017. Make Your Move -- the Campaign for Eby and Hickok -- included \$24
million in essential enhancements, including an Athletic and Recreation
Complex project as well as the renovation and expansion of Hickok Hall,
one of the College's main academic buildings. The result is vastly
improved academic, recreational, wellness and competition facilities to
benefit future generations of students.

The academic year consists of three terms (see Academic Calendar,
p.~15). Students normally take four course credits in the Fall Term and
four course credits in the Spring Term. Thus, eight course credits are
completed in an academic year. During optional May Term, students may
enroll for up to one course credit in one of the limited selection of
courses. Summer term is limited in scope and is not considered a regular
term. (The maximum course load is described in Course Load, p.~53).

of the limited selection of courses. All May Term courses require
consent of instructor prior to registration. May Term courses are
designed to meet at least two of the following shared learning outcomes:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Evaluate and engage with complex interdependent systems and
  demonstrate understanding across diverse contexts.
\item
  Critically describe and break apart issues or problems through
  systematic analysis and illustrate logic for conclusions.
\item
  Engage with experiential learning practices such as learning by doing,
  while utilizing abilities to think critically, problem solve and make
  connections between knowledge gained in the classroom and experience
  beyond.
\end{itemize}

May Term courses are expected to have the same amount of contact time
and academic rigor per course credit as courses which meet over a Fall
or Spring Term.~ For every 1 course credit of May term students are
expected to complete 140 hours of work. Such contact time includes class
meetings, lectures by the instructor, supervised course related
activities and independent out of class activities.~ Off-campus May Term
courses at an off-campus location provide certain educational benefits
through site visits, guest lectures, etc., that also contribute to the
contact time for the course.

\chapter{COE PLAN}\label{coe-plan}}

Coe College's requirements for graduation, commonly known as the Coe
Plan were developed with the following outcomes in mind:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Creation of a bridge from high school to Coe College that helps
  students understand the importance of a liberal arts education, the
  ways to develop the skills needed by any learner, and the
  opportunities they will have by going to Coe College.
\item
  Development of required curriculum that exposes the students to ways
  of learning in various contexts, big ideas in a myriad of disciplines,
  ways of being and understanding of cultures around the world, and
  processes to develop the skills needed by any learner.
\item
  Creation of a bridge from Coe College to life after Coe.
\end{itemize}

These outcomes are met through the College's First-Year Experience,
General Education program, Writing Emphasis courses, and the College's
Practicum experiences and areas of study, described in this section of
the Catalog.

\hypertarget{graduation-requirements}{%
\chapter{GRADUATION REQUIREMENTS}\label{graduation-requirements}}

All students who graduate from Coe College must complete at least one
major and earn at least 32 course credits (cc) with grades leading to a
cumulative grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 or higher. (The course is
the unit of academic credit.) Courses are one credit unless otherwise
indicated. Students are expected to complete 180 hours of work to earn
one course credit, although class times vary from course to course.
Other institutions may convert Coe credit to their system by considering
one course credit to be 6 quarter hours, or 4 semester hours.) No more
than a total of two course credits from courses which are less than 0.5
credit can be used to meet the 32-credit graduation requirement. No more
than eight course credits earned of Advanced Placement or International
Baccalaureate credit can be used to satisfy this requirement.

Students must meet one of the following requirements:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Complete at least the final academic year of required courses
  registered through Coe.
\item
  Earn a total of 16 course credits or the equivalent at Coe. The last
  eight course credits needed for graduation must include at least four
  earned at Coe. Approved off-campus study programs and internships can
  be used to fulfill this requirement.
\end{itemize}

A student may be simultaneously awarded two degrees (B.A., B.M., B.S.N.)
after satisfactorily completing 40 course credits and the requirements
for both degrees. However, a simultaneous Bachelor of Music plus a
Bachelor of Arts with a music major is not permitted.

In addition, students must fulfill the requirements of the First-Year
Experience, General Education, Writing Emphasis, and Practicum.

To participate in Commencement exercises, students must submit a
completed Intent to Graduate form to the Office of the Registrar,
preferably three terms prior to Commencement.

\hypertarget{second-baccalaureate-degree}{%
\section{Second Baccalaureate
Degree}\label{second-baccalaureate-degree}}

A student who holds a baccalaureate degree from another institution may
earn a second baccalaureate degree at Coe, if the following criteria are
met:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The first degree must be from a regionally accredited institution as
  recognized by the US Department of Education, or another appropriate
  accrediting body.
\item
  The first degree must be completed (not in progress) before beginning
  the second degree at Coe.
\end{itemize}

Students accepted at Coe to pursue a second degree are granted a maximum
of 24 course credits in transfer credit towards the 32 course credits
required for graduation. To graduate, at least eight course credits must
be earned at Coe College and all requirements for the major area of
study must be met with at least 40\% of the major course credits taken
at Coe. Students must earn a cumulative GPA of at least 2.0 as well as
meet any GPA or grade requirements in their area of study.

Second baccalaureate students are exempt from the following
requirements: first-year experience, general education, writing
emphasis, and practicum. They are not eligible to graduate with Latin
Honors or for induction in Phi Beta Kappa or Phi Kappa Phi.

\hypertarget{transfer-student-information}{%
\section{Transfer Student
Information}\label{transfer-student-information}}

To honor its mission and to preserve its academic integrity as a liberal
arts institution, the College accepts a course in transfer if that
course meets the spirit of the College's mission and is from a
regionally accredited institution. This section includes information, in
addition to that included in the section, Graduation Requirements (see
p.~16), germane to students who are transferring to Coe College from
another college or university.

Courses transferred to Coe can, as approved by the Registrar, fulfill
some graduation requirements. From institutions on a semester hour
system (at Coe, 1 course credit = 4 semester hours), only courses with
three or more semester hours can be used to fulfill any major or general
education requirements. From institutions on other than a semester hour
system, only courses equivalent to at least 0.75 course credits can be
used to fulfill any major or general education requirement. In some
cases, in consultation with the Registrar, multiple courses within the
same field may be used to fulfill one requirement.

Transfer credits earned after high-school graduation and before Coe
matriculation count towards the eight term, full-time residence
requirement (see p.~230). Full-time enrollment may include participation
in Coe College exchange programs, ACM off-campus study programs, and
other approved off-campus study programs.

All students must complete at Coe at least 40\% of the total course
credits required for each declared major or minor or three course
credits, whichever is greater. In addition to completing at least one
major area of study, transfer students must abide with the following to
complete the requirements for graduation:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  First-Year Experience. Transfer students are not required to fulfill
  the requirements of the First-Year Experience, if they have completed
  at least one full-time college term since graduation from high school.
\item
  Writing Emphasis. (See Writing Emphasis Courses, p.~21).
\item
  General Education. Requirements include Liberal Arts selections in the
  four divisional areas (Natural and Mathematical Sciences, Social
  Sciences, Humanities, Fine Arts) and Diverse Cultural Perspectives
  courses. Any courses accepted in transfer for at least 0.75 course
  credit that fit the criteria of the Liberal Arts and/or Diverse
  Cultural Perspectives core groups can be applied towards the general
  education requirements as determined by the Registrar. Advanced
  Placement and International Baccalaureate courses may not be used to
  meet any part of the General Education requirements.
\item
  Academic Practicum. Transfer students are required to fulfill this
  requirement.

\hypertarget{academic-advising}{%
\chapter{ACADEMIC ADVISING}\label{academic-advising}}

The role of the academic advisor is to acquaint students with their
academic options at Coe and assist them in selecting courses that
reflect individual interests and abilities. Advisors also help students
create a four-year education plan that allows students to make
connections between disparate areas of study, and between academic,
co-curricular, and non-academic areas. Students may change advisors at
any time upon request to the Registrar.

First-Year Seminar instructors serve as the primary academic advisors
for first-year students in their respective sections. Students thus see
their advisors frequently during their first term at Coe and have the
opportunity to work closely with them in developing overall programs of
study and long-range goals. After the first term, students may decide to
choose departmental faculty for academic advising or they may continue
to be advised by their First-Year Seminar instructors. Students are free
to speak at any time with professors in their major departments to
answer specific questions regarding requirements and courses in those
departments.

\bookmarksetup{startatroot}

\hypertarget{first-year-experience}{%
\chapter{FIRST-YEAR EXPERIENCE}\label{first-year-experience}}

The student's First-Year Experience at Coe is a deliberate strategy to
engage first-year students across multiple dimensions of college life in
the first year. Components of the First-Year Experience include writing
exercises, various campus events, and the First-Year Seminar (FYS).

The First-Year Seminar is required for all students who have not yet
completed a full-time college term after high school graduation. During
the Fall Term, a variety of First-Year Seminars---topics courses
exploring issues from multiple perspectives---are offered. The seminars
emphasize critical thinking, writing, speaking and research skills.

All First-Year Seminars carry the writing emphasis designation.
First-Year Seminar courses cannot fulfill any distributional, cultural
perspective, or major requirements. Students who drop or fail their
First-Year Seminar are required to complete a replacement course
designated by the Registrar the following term. The completion of this
Spring Term course makes it possible for the student to fulfill the FYS
graduation requirement. For students who fail the Fall Term First-Year
Seminar, successful completion of the Spring Term course also allows the
grade in the FYS to be changed from ``F'' to ``NP'' on the transcript.

Students who begin their college enrollment in the Spring Term must also
complete a course designated as a replacement.

\hypertarget{writing-emphasis-courses}{%
\chapter{WRITING EMPHASIS COURSES}\label{writing-emphasis-courses}}

\textbf{Writing Across the Curriculum: Statement of Guiding Principles}

As stated in the Coe College Mission Statement, our reason to exist as
an institution is to ready students intellectually, professionally, and
socially to lead productive and satisfying lives in the global society
of the 21st century. In accordance with this mission, our curriculum
requires that students undertake ``a series of intensive writing
experiences, spread across four years of study.'' This requirement is
known as Writing Across the Curriculum, the guiding principles of which
are detailed below.

As a philosophy, Writing Across the Curriculum asserts that writing is
most effectively learned in context: to varied audiences, with varied
purposes. In adopting this philosophy, Coe College has committed to
making writing-intensive experiences available to students in all
disciplines. Known as ``Writing Emphasis'' credits, these courses are
divergent in subject matter but aligned in their commitment to giving
students content-rich and context-specific writing experiences that
foster a critical flexibility in transferring knowledge about effective
writing to multiple, even unknown, contexts.

Therefore, students who complete the requisite number of writing
emphasis courses will graduate from Coe knowing that writing is both a
means and an end: a method for exploring ideas and deepening one's
knowledge as well as a tool for sharing that knowledge and expressing
one's point of view. Similarly, graduating students will know that the
practice of writing is a recursive process rooted in revision, which
refers both to the reconsideration of one's ideas and to the refinement
of prose, and this process unfolds over a lifetime. Understanding that
students will encounter innumerable writing situations in their lives,
many of which may be unfamiliar to them, they will graduate from Coe
having developed the confidence and self-efficacy necessary to adapt or
draw from their existing knowledge in order to navigate new contexts.

Although many courses at Coe may include writing activities, courses
endorsed by Writing Across the Curriculum are those in which: - Students
are given opportunities to practice revision, whether via multiple
drafts of a single project or multiple iterations of the same type of
assignment; - Students receive instructor feedback on written work to
facilitate revision; and - Writing assignments are frequent enough that
they are integral to the learning throughout the course, enabling
students to develop in one or more of the following learning outcomes,
as appropriate to discipline and course objectives: - How to write for
specific purposes and audiences - Including attention to the ways
purposes and audiences shape form, mode, voice, method, organization,
engagement with and citation of research, and/or creativity and
imagination - How to engage in critical thinking - Particularly how to
conduct analysis, how to synthesize information, how to interpret and/or
use evidence and data, and how to present one's ideas coherently and
stylistically - How to practice, assess, and develop effective habits
for writing - Specifically, how to read deeply, how to begin and later
practice selection in research, how to be a skilled reader of one's own
and others' in-process writing, how to accept and interpret feedback,
and how to revise writing, all of which are parts of the process of
learning how to have and develop ideas - How to engage in writing as a
method for learning and discovery - For deepening knowledge, thinking
through questions and problems, and reflecting on connections and growth
- How to name and describe one's own knowledge for others - For example,
in the form of personal statements for application to graduate study,
cover letters and resumes for entering and advancing in the workforce,
or other forms of self-summary that facilitate transition from the
baccalaureate environment through the broader public.

Many writing emphasis sections are offered each year, and, in addition,
the College's rhetoric department offers several interdisciplinary
writing courses designed to guide students learning to write effectively
at the college level. (See course descriptions starting on p.~70).
General Education or major courses that are also designated as writing
emphasis courses may be used to satisfy both requirements.

In this catalog, writing emphasis courses are designated by a (WE) after
the course title, e.g.~``RHE-200 Rhetorical Theory \& Practice (WE).''
In other contexts, the course code may end with a ``W''
(e.g.~RHE-200-W). All sections of such a course, regardless of
instructor, will carry writing emphasis credit.

Fulfilling the Writing Emphasis Requirement:

Only designated WE courses in which a student earns a grade of ``C''
(2.0) or better count toward fulfillment of this requirement.

Only designated courses taken at Coe College count toward fulfillment of
this requirement.

Undergraduate degree-seeking* students - who start at Coe College or who
transfer fewer than 8 course credits earned after graduation from high
school must complete at least 5 writing emphasis courses. Of these 5,
one will usually be the FYS. Of the remaining 4, it is recommended (but
not required) that at least 1 be taken outside the student's intended
major(s). - who transfer at least 8 but fewer than 16 course credits to
Coe, earned after graduation from high school, must complete at least 3
writing emphasis courses. - who transfer 16 or more course credits to
Coe, earned after graduation from high school, must complete at least 2
writing emphasis credits. For all students, regardless of transfer
credit, it is recommended (but not required) that at least one writing
emphasis course be taken in the upper division within the student's
intended major(s). ``Upper division'' courses are defined in this case
as those numbered 300 and above; upper division writing emphasis courses
could include both scheduled classroom courses and arranged
writing-based capstone projects (such as a thesis). See Departmental
Writing Plans for more information on writing in the major(s). *Students
seeking a second undergraduate degree from Coe should see Second
Baccalaureate Degree p.~16.

\hypertarget{course-numbering}{%
\subsubsection{COURSE NUMBERING}\label{course-numbering}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Courses numbered 100--199 are introductory to the subject.
\item
  Courses numbered 200--299 assume a capacity for the independent
  acquisition of material and generally build on the methods and subject
  matter of 100-level courses.
\item
  Courses numbered 300--399 are typically oriented toward a major or
  minor. They require a strong foundation of knowledge specific to the
  discipline.
\item
  Courses numbered 400--499 are courses in the major or minor that are
  designed to challenge students to integrate discipline-specific
  knowledge in advanced ways. These courses typically contain advanced
  disciplinary coursework, capstone projects, and/or independent
  research.

Typically completed in the student's junior or senior year, all practica
are experiences that integrate academic components with career or other
life goals and are significant educational exercises outside the
classroom. A practicum experience can consist of an internship,
off-campus study, community-based project, honors project, or some other
kind of independent activity.

Depending upon the type selected, some practica are graded A--F, while
others are P/NP. Some practica are credit bearing, while others are not.
In some instances, the practicum must be approved by the student's major
department.

\subsection{On-Campus and Off-Campus Resident
Students}\label{on-campus-and-off-campus-resident-students}}

As a residential, liberal arts college, we seek to provide an
environment where learning by all members of the community occurs in and
out of the classroom and where curricular and co-curricular activities
reinforce our commitment to the life of the mind. Such experiences occur
best when students are living and learning full-time on campus. The
residential life program is an integral part of the education program
and support services at Coe College. Residence halls and hall staff
provide a structure by which the experience of the classroom is joined
with the out-of-class learning experience of the student.

Full-time students are required to live in residence and take meals in
the college dining hall and, thereby, are charged for room and board
unless exempt for one or more of the following reasons: 1. Married
students -- must provide copy of signed marriage license 2. Live with
parent(s)/guardian(s) within 25 miles of campus (address on file with
College is verified) 3. Dependent child (person must provide copy of
child's birth certificate) 4. Completed 8 semesters living on campus 5.
Students who are 25 years or older.

Other exceptions to the residence requirement must be applied for in
writing to the Dean of Students. Approval or denial is determined on a
case-by-case basis following evaluation of the extenuating circumstances
provided for review. Students are notified in writing of the decision.
Permission to live off campus must be on file in the Residence Life
Office and must be renewed each year. Students who violate the residence
requirement are charged full room and board costs for the entire year.
Coe funded scholarships and grants will typically be reduced by
approximately 10 percent when a student moves off campus.

\hypertarget{acm-and-other-off-campus-study-programs}{%
\subsection{ACM and Other Off-Campus Study
Programs}\label{acm-and-other-off-campus-study-programs}}

Students desiring to study off-campus must first obtain approval from
the Director of Off-Campus study. In every case, students are
responsible for their own transportation and living expenses. Each
student is advised to check with the program's director as to the cost
(and other details) of each program. This charge could vary
significantly from the cost of remaining on campus. The tuition charged
for Fall or Spring Term off-campus programs will be Coe's tuition or the
tuition for the off-campus program if greater than Coe's tuition. In
addition to tuition, Coe will charge the off-campus program fee as
billed by the off-campus program. Students maintain their eligibility
for federal and state financial aid; however, Coe financial aid
availability is subject to approval by the Committee on
Internationalization. Students registered for the optional May Term who
desire to study off-campus (except Coe-sponsored programs) are billed a
surcharge fee for tuition and/or program costs which are greater than
10\% of Coe's annual tuition. Tuition and fees for ACM off-campus study
programs or study programs sponsored by other colleges must be paid in
full prior to attending the off-campus program.

\textbf{NOTE}: \emph{Students on regular-term Coe-administered programs
including exchanges are able to use their Coe College gift aid to pay
tuition that term. Domestic students on other providers' programs may be
able to utilize a portion of their Coe gift aid. International students
may be able to utilize a portion of their Coe gift aid toward tuition
for ACM or other providers' domestic but not international programs. In
all cases, students in an off-campus program are not charged the
student-activity or health fee.}

\hypertarget{payment-policy}{%
\section{PAYMENT POLICY}\label{payment-policy}}

The Net Comprehensive Fee, the Comprehensive Fee less financial aid
(with the exception of the work study) is due and payable by August
1\textsuperscript{st} for the Fall Term and January
10\textsuperscript{th} for the Spring Term.

\hypertarget{monthly-payment-plan}{%
\subsection{Monthly Payment Plan}\label{monthly-payment-plan}}

The College offers a monthly payment plan for those parents/students who
desire to budget the costs of tuition, room, and board in 5 monthly
payments per term. Under this plan, the first payment for the Fall Term
is due August 1\textsuperscript{st}, and the final payment is due
December 10\textsuperscript{th}. The payment plan for the Spring Term
begins January 10\textsuperscript{th} and the final payment is due May
10\textsuperscript{th} (graduating seniors' final payment is due the
last Friday in April). There is a \$50 non-refundable enrollment fee per
term to be on the monthly payment plan. Students enroll in the monthly
payment plan through CASHNet via their
\textless my.coe.edu\textgreater{} account.

If, after enrolling in the monthly payment plan, the student's charges
or financial aid changes, the student account and monthly payments are
adjusted accordingly. All refunds are made in accordance with the refund
policy as stated in the \emph{Coe Student Accounts Handbook}. If a
student on the monthly payment plan withdraws from Coe, charges and
excess payments will be refunded in accordance with the College's refund
policy. The \$50 enrollment fee will not be refunded. Information on
this plan is available on \textless my.coe.edu\textgreater.

To give parents/students as much time as possible to make arrangements
for their financial obligation or to take advantage of Coe's monthly
payment plan, the Business Office generates an online billing statement
in mid-July. Any special fees, such as music lessons, are billed after
the start of classes and are payable by the tenth of the following
month.

\hypertarget{late-payments}{%
\subsection{Late Payments}\label{late-payments}}

If a student chooses to pay his/her college charges on the semester
payment schedule (payment in full is due August 1\textsuperscript{st}
and January 10\textsuperscript{th}) late payments are subject to a late
fee/finance charge of 1.25\% per month (or fraction thereof) on the full
amount that is past due. This is equivalent to an annual rate of 15\%.

\hypertarget{official-withdrawal-from-all-courses}{%
\subsection{Official Withdrawal from all
Courses}\label{official-withdrawal-from-all-courses}}

Students who withdraw from or cease attendance in all of their courses
have the responsibility of initiating the official withdrawal process
(see (\textbf{official-withdrawal-process?}) ).

If a student is unable to complete the official withdrawal process, the
intent to withdraw can be communicated to one of the following offices:
Registrar, Student Financial Services, Student Life, Student Success and
Persistence.

Special consideration is given to students who withdrew due to a call to
active duty. Coe's ``Military Call Up/Refund'' and ``Readmission of
Service Member'' policies are published on the Admission/Financial Aid
webpage. Copies of these policies can be requested from the Student
Financial Services Office.

\hypertarget{unofficial-withdrawal-from-all-courses}{%
\subsection{Unofficial Withdrawal from all
Courses}\label{unofficial-withdrawal-from-all-courses}}

Students who did not earn credit for any of the courses they were
registered for in a given term and did not officially withdraw or
otherwise provide notice of their intent to withdraw, must be considered
``unofficially withdrawn''. Federal regulations mandate that, a federal
Title IV refund calculation, using the withdrawal date of either the
midpoint of the term or the last date of attendance at a documented
academically related activity, must be performed.

\textbf{A student's withdrawal date is:} The earlier of the date that
the student began the official withdrawal process or otherwise provided
official notification to a designated office of their intent to
withdraw; OR If official notification could not be provided because of
circumstances beyond the student's control, the date the college
determines is related to the particular circumstance; OR If the student
ceased attendance without providing official notification, the midpoint
of the term; OR The student's last date of attendance at a documented
academically related activity.

\hypertarget{sec-federal-title-IV-refund-calculation-policy}{%
\subsection{Federal Title IV Refund
Calculation/Policy}\label{sec-federal-title-IV-refund-calculation-policy}}

In accordance with federal regulations, a Title IV refund calculation
must be performed for students that are recipients of Federal Student
Aid (FSA) who cease attendance in all courses, including students who
are expelled, or are granted a leave of absence. The FSA programs that
are covered by this law are: Federal Pell Grants, TEACH Grants, Stafford
Loans, PLUS Loans, Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants
(FSEOG), Iraq Afghanistan Service Grant, and other Title IV Programs.
The Coe College Student Financial Services Office determines, based on
the *federally mandated formula, the amount of FSA assistance students
have earned based on the date in the term a student is considered to be
withdrawn. An example of the refund calculation is published online in
the {[}Financial Aid Handbook{]}
(https://www.coe.edu/admission/financial-aid-scholarships/financial-aid-handbook)
and a handout may be obtained from the Student Financial Services
Office.

\hypertarget{return-of-financial-aid-funds-policy-steps}{%
\subsection{Return of Financial Aid Funds Policy
Steps}\label{return-of-financial-aid-funds-policy-steps}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Step 1: Determine the percentage of enrollment period completed by the
  student. If the calculated percentage is equal to or greater than
  60\%, the student has ``earned'' all aid for the enrollment period and
  no adjustment in financial aid occurs.

  Days Attended ÷ Days in Enrollment Period = Percentage Completed
\item
  Step 2: Apply the percentage completed to the Title IV aid award to
  determine the student's eligibility for financial aid prior to the
  withdrawal.

  (Total Aid Disbursed + Aid that could have been disbursed) x
  Percentage Completed = Earned Aid
\item
  Step 3: Determine the amount of unearned financial aid to be returned
  to the appropriate Title IV financial aid program.

  Total Disbursed Aid -- Earned Aid = Unearned Aid to be Returned

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    If the aid already disbursed equals the earned aid, no further
    action is required.
  \item
    If the aid already disbursed is greater than the earned aid, the
    difference must be returned to the appropriate Title IV aid program.
  \item
    If the aid already disbursed is less than the earned aid, a late
    disbursement may be made to the student.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Step 4: Determine if the institution and/or the student must return
  the unearned funds.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Total Aid -- Earned Aid = Unearned aid that must be returned
  \item
    Unearned Aid \textgreater{} assessed charges = Unearned aid that
    must be returned by the student
  \item
    Unearned Aid ≤ assessed charges = Unearned aid to be returned by the
    College
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

The Coe College Student Financial Service Office is required to return
any unearned FSA funds that were applied towards institutional charges
within 45 days in the following order: + Direct Unsubsidized Stafford
Loan + Direct (Subsidized) Stafford Loan + Direct Graduate PLUS Loan
(for graduate students) + Direct PLUS Loan (for parents of undergraduate
students) + Pell Grant + SEOG + TEACH Grant + Iraq Afghanistan Service
Grant

The student will be informed by the Student Financial Services Office of
the type and amount of FSA program funds that are being returned on
their behalf and of the amount the student must return. If the student's
portion of aid to be returned is a loan, the terms of the original loan
repayment agreement will apply. The amount of unearned grant funds a
student must repay is limited to the amount by which unearned grant
funds disbursed exceed half of the original grant award by \$50 or more.
In general, the Student Financial Services Office will return the grant
funds to the appropriate federal program and charge the student's Coe
account, which will result in debt to the college.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Step 5: Determine earned FSA assistance that has not been disbursed.

  Total Aid Earned -- Total Aid Disbursed = Earned Aid not Disbursed
\end{itemize}

Grant aid that was earned, but had not been applied before the student
withdrew, will be applied to the students account within 45 days. Loan
proceeds that could be disbursed after the student withdrew will only be
disbursed if the student requests a disbursement within 14 days of
receiving notice from the Student Financial Services of their
eligibility of a post-withdrawal loan disbursement.

\hypertarget{institutional-refund-calculationpolicy}{%
\subsection{Institutional Refund
Calculation/Policy}\label{institutional-refund-calculationpolicy}}

The Student Financial Services will follow the federal Title IV Refund
Calculation/ Policy in determining the amount of earned and unearned Coe
scholarships and grants and state assistance.

Tuition, Board and Student Fees will be charged pro-rata based on the
percentage of the enrollment period completed up to the 60-percentage
point in time of the term. Room charge will not be refunded after Date
of Record for the term. Please see the Coe \emph{Student Accounts
Handbook} to review the institutional refund policy for tuition, fees,
room and board.

\hypertarget{may-term-optional-1}{%
\subsection{May Term (optional)}\label{may-term-optional-1}}

The first May Term course taken by a student is a non-tuition charge
term for all Coe full-time degree-seeking students enrolled in the
Spring Term, therefore, no institutional aid is awarded to students. A
\$1000 fee per May Term course will be assessed for subsequent May Term
courses taken by a student. Please see the \emph{Coe Student Accounts
Handbook} for more information about May Term.

\hypertarget{enrollment-status-changes}{%
\subsection{Enrollment Status Changes}\label{enrollment-status-changes}}

Changes in enrollment status from full-time to part-time may affect a
student's financial assistance. In general, the amount of financial aid
a student is eligible to receive is based on the enrollment status as of
the College's official date of record. Federal direct loans will no
longer be in an in-school deferment status for a student who drops below
half-time at any time during the term Students should consult with the
Student Financial Services to discuss how enrollment changes will affect
their financial aid eligibility and loan deferment status.

\hypertarget{part-time-students}{%
\subsection{Part-Time Students}\label{part-time-students}}

A part-time student withdrawing from all courses in the Fall or Spring

\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{need-based-financial-aid}{%
\subsection{Need-based Financial Aid}\label{need-based-financial-aid}}

Need-based financial aid is available to students who are admitted to
Coe College and file the Free Application for Federal Student Aid
(FAFSA). These assistance programs are based on the premise that
students and parents should pay for college to the extent that they are
able. Need-based financial aid is used to help make up the difference
between the cost of college and what a family can afford.

When a FAFSA is filed, a standard formula is used to calculate the
expected family contribution -- the amount that the student and his or
her family are expected to pay. The Student Financial Services Office
compares the expected family contribution (EFC) to estimated cost of
attendance. If the costs exceed the amount of the EFC, the student is
eligible for need-based financial aid. A typical financial aid package
will contain a combination of gift aid (scholarships and grants) and
self-help aid (low-interest educational loans and employment).
Information released to Coe College through the FAFSA application is
kept confidential.

Application for all need-based financial aid programs must be made for
each year the student is enrolled. The FAFSA is available online at
\href{www.fafsa.gov}{Federal Student Aid}.

\textbf{Verification Process}

\begin{verbatim}
Federal regulations require that some applicants who are eligible for need-based financial aid complete the verification process. Students may be chosen for verification by the U.S. Department of Education or by Coe College. Applicants selected for verification are required to submit supporting documentation to the Student Financial Services. These supporting documents may include, but are not limited to, copies of student and parent IRS tax transcripts from a prior tax year, verification of untaxed income received, family size and the number of family members attending college during the next academic year. Returning students selected for verification will not receive a financial aid award offer until all requested documents are received and reviewed by the Student Financial Services Office. Prospective students will receive a preliminary financial aid award offer prior to completion of verification. In order to finalize the awards offered, all requested documents should be received by the Student Financial Services Office at least one month prior to the end of the award period. A financial aid award is subject to change if verification results in a change to the Expected Family Contribution (EFC). During the verification process the Student Financial Services Office will contact students if clarification is needed on any of the information reported on the FAFSA or if it is necessary to make corrections to the FAFSA data. 
\end{verbatim}

\hypertarget{need-based-gift-aid}{%
\subsection{Need-based Gift Aid}\label{need-based-gift-aid}}

Gift aid does not have to be repaid by the student. Need-based gift aid
is available through federal, state, institutional and outside sources.
+ \textbf{Coe Grant} The value of a \textbf{Coe Grant} is influenced by
a student's financial need. The amount of the Coe Grant can vary from
year to year, depending on changes in family income, room and board
charges, and the availability of funding. Coe has many endowed
scholarships that have been established by generous alumni and friends
of the College. Income from these scholarships is used primarily to
support Coe funded merit- and need-based aid. Students awarded Coe aid
may be asked to complete an `Endowed Scholarship Application.' The
Financial Aid Office will use information from this application to match
students with endowed scholarships. Students designated to have their
Coe aid funded by an endowed scholarship may be contacted by the Coe
College Advancement Office with information about their donor.
(\textbf{Note}: Endowed scholarships funds support Coe funded aid
already granted to the student. Under no circumstances will the student
receive additional funding beyond what has already been listed on the
financial aid award letter.) Endowed scholarship funds are vital sources
of assistance for many of our students. It will be requested that each
student receiving funds from an endowed scholarship write a letter of
thanks to the donor or the designated official. Donor information and
letter suggestions will be provided by the Office of Advancement.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Federal Pell Grant} The Federal Pell Grant program is designed
  to provide financial assistance to eligible undergraduates.
  Application is made by filing a Free Application for Federal Student
  Aid (FAFSA). The Federal Pell Grant program provides grants to full-
  and part-time students and may be used at any eligible college or
  university that the student attends as an undergraduate or until the
  student receive a first baccalaureate degree. The award amount may
  vary according to the cost of the institution and the number of hours
  for which a student is enrolled. A student may receive no more than
  the equivalent of 12 full-time term awards. Students must be enrolled
  for three or more course credits per term to receive the full award.
  At press time, the current 2022--2023 Federal Pell grants awards range
  from \$750 up to \$6,845. However, final Pell Grant amounts are
  subject to the federal budget process and could very well be reduced.
  These grants are generally available to families with modest incomes.
\item
  \textbf{Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (SEOG)} The
  Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (SEOG) program
  provides financial grant assistance to Pell Grant eligible
  undergraduates with exceptional financial need which, for the purposes
  of this program, is defined as those with the lowest EFC. The grants
  are made from funds provided by the federal government to Coe College.
  The College, in turn, selects needy students who have applied for
  financial aid and meet awarding criteria established by the federal
  government. SEOG awards at Coe are based on the availability of
  funding and can range from \$100 up to \$1,000 per academic year.
  These funds are limited and not all students who qualify can be
  assured that they will receive a SEOG grant.
\item
  \textbf{Iowa Tuition Grant (ITG)} The Iowa Tuition Grant (ITG) is
  available to qualified, undergraduate Iowa residents who are enrolled
  at least one quarter time (one course credit) at a private college in
  Iowa. A student may receive the ITG for no more than eight full-time
  terms. The ITG is based on financial need and a FAFSA filing deadline
  of July 1 \textsuperscript{st}.Application to receive the ITG at Coe
  can be made by listing Coe College on the FAFSA. For the 2021-22
  academic year, students whose Expected Family Contribution (EFC) is no
  greater than \$15,000 may qualify for a maximum full-time award of
  \$6,800.
\item
  \textbf{National Presbyterian Scholarships} National Presbyterian
  Scholarships are offered to members of the Presbyterian Church
  (U.S.A.) who plan to attend one of the participating Presbyterian
  colleges, including Coe College. Students must file a separate
  application to the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) by December
  1\textsuperscript{st}. Only incoming first-year students may apply for
  these need-based renewable scholarships. (Applicants must complete the
  FAFSA to renew the scholarship.)

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{The Education Assistance for College and Higher Education
  (TEACH)} The Education Assistance for College and Higher Education
  (TEACH) program is designed to provide financial assistance of up to
  \$4,000 per academic year to current and prospective teachers. To
  qualify for a TEACH Grant a student must have scored above the 75th
  percentile on any portion of the ACT or SAT (including composite
  scores) or have a 3.25 cumulative grade point average. First-year
  students must have a final cumulative high school grade point average
  of at least a 3.25 and upperclassmen must maintain a minimum
  cumulative GPA of 3.25 each Term. In addition, a recipient must serve
  as a full-time teacher in a high-need field, in a school serving
  low-income students for at least four academic years within eight
  years. If a student does not complete the required teaching
  obligation, the grant must be repaid as a Direct Unsubsidized Federal
  Direct Stafford Loan with interest from the time the grant was
  disbursed.
\item
  \textbf{Active Duty Military Benefits} An individual who is currently
  serving in the military or who is the spouse or dependent child of a
  service member who is currently serving on active duty, may be
  eligible for funding offered through the Department of Defense Tuition
  Assistance program. Applicants are encouraged to check their
  eligibility status and amount for which they qualify with their
  service prior to enrolling.
\item
  \textbf{Iowa National Guard Educational Assistance Grant} The Iowa
  National Guard Educational Assistance Grant (NGEAP) provides annual
  awards to Iowa National Guard members who attend eligible Iowa
  colleges and universities. Eligibility is determined by the Iowa
  Adjutant General. Maximum individual awards cannot exceed the current
  average resident tuition rate at Iowa Regent Universities. The maximum
  award amount for the 2021--22 academic year was \$9,660.
\item
  \textbf{ROTC Scholarships and Grants} ROTC Scholarships and Grants are
  available through Coe College. The College ROTC program provides
  on-campus leadership training in conjunction with a student's current
  curriculum. The scholarship provides payment of up to full tuition and
  fees for a given academic year and approximately \$600 per term for
  books, and a subsistence allowance of up to \$500 per month up to 10
  months per academic year. ROTC-eligible students should contact the
  Student Financial Services to determine the impact this scholarship
  will have on their total financial aid package.
\item
  \textbf{Veterans' Educational Benefits} The Veterans Administration
  administers programs for veterans and service people seeking
  assistance for education and training. A veteran or dependent of a
  veteran who plans to receive educational benefits, as determined by
  the Department of Veteran Affairs, should contact the Registrar's
  Office well in advance of enrollment to request certification.
  Additional information about veterans' benefits at Coe College, such
  as the application process for the various programs, available
  resources, as well as withdrawal and readmit policies for service
  members, can be found on the

  College's Resources for Veterans and Military Students.}
\item
  \textbf{The Yellow Ribbon GI Educational Enhancement Program} The
  Yellow Ribbon GI Educational Enhancement Program is a provision of the
  Post-9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2008. The program is
  designed to supplement the Post-9/11 tuition benefit, which is limited
  to the highest public in-state undergraduate tuition. Under the Yellow
  Ribbon program, Coe College entered into an agreement with the
  Department of Veterans Affairs to jointly pay the portion of an
  eligible veteran's net tuition and fees that exceed the maximum amount
  otherwise provided by the Post-9/11 GI Bill. Veterans are encouraged
  to visit the VA's Yellow Ribbon webpage to determine their
  eligibility. While not required to file a FAFSA, applicants are
  strongly encouraged to do so in order to potentially maximize federal
  and/or state benefits.
\item
  \textbf{Vocational Rehabilitation Benefits} The Division of Vocational
  and Rehabilitation of the Iowa Department of Public Instruction or a
  similar division in other states make assistance available to
  physically and mentally challenged students who are residents of the
  state. More information is available from the Division of Vocational

\subsection{Tution Discount}\label{tution-discount}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Continuing Student Discount} Undergraduate and
  Post-baccalaureate students who do not qualify for Coe scholarships
  and grants may contact the Office of Student Financial Services to
  determine whether they qualify for a tuition discount.
\item
  \textbf{Teacher Education Discount} Qualifying education students
  enrolled in Coe's Ninth-Term/Fifth-Year programs may obtain an
  application from the Education Department for a discount of up to 60\%
  of regular full-time tuition charges. Students should contact the
  Education Department for detailed instructions and deadlines for
  applying (rates subject to change).
\item
  \textbf{Accounting Discount} Full-time students who are pursuing a
  major in public accounting, have not completed their degree
  requirements in four years, and are in good academic standing receive
  a tuition discount of 60\% of regular tuition charges in their fifth
  consecutive year of study (rates subject to change).
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{federal-self-help-aid}{%
\subsection{Federal Self-help Aid}\label{federal-self-help-aid}}

Self-help aid may be need or non-need-based. Students apply for these
funds by completing the FAFSA. Once awarded, the Student Financial
Services will provide any additional paperwork that may be necessary.
Self-help aid requires work for compensation or repayment of
low-interest student loans. Eligibility for these programs is determined
yearly and requires that the FAFSA be filed each year.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Work-Study Awards} provide part-time employment on campus, at
  area non-profit agencies and in local schools.
\item
  \textbf{William D. Ford Federal Direct Stafford Loans} William D. Ford
  Federal Direct Stafford Loans must be repaid by the student. The
  Federal Direct Stafford (FDS) loan program allows students to borrow
  low-interest loans directly from the federal government. To qualify
  for an FDS loan, a student must file the FAFSA, be admitted to a
  degree or certificate program, and be enrolled at least half-time (2.0
  course credits).
\item
  \textbf{Loan Types}

  There are two types of Federal Direct Stafford loans: subsidized and
  unsubsidized. The interest rate for loans processed during the
  2021--22 academic year is fixed at 3.73 percent. A 1.057\% origination
  fee is subtracted from the loan funds. Please note, interest rates,
  subsidies, and origination fees may change. Updated information will
  be published as it becomes available.

  A student must have financial need to receive a subsidized loan.
  Financial need is not required to be eligible for an unsubsidized
  loan. During the time that a student is enrolled on at least a
  half-time basis (two course credits per term) the federal government
  will pay the interest on a subsidized FDS loan. Interest will accrue
  during the in-school periods on an unsubsidized FDS loan. A student
  has the option of paying the interest during in-school periods or
  adding the interest to the principal of the loan. Principal payments
  begin after the six-month grace period.

  Once a student is no longer enrolled at least half-time, repayment
  begins after a six-month grace period. During the grace period, the
  student will receive repayment information from the loan servicer,
  including the first payment due date. Information on the servicer
  assigned to a student's loans can be looked up on
  \href{studentaid.gov.}{Federal Student Aid}
\item
  \textbf{Federal Direct Parent Loan for Undergraduate Student's (PLUS)}
  Parents who can demonstrate good credit may borrow the difference
  between the student's costs of attendance less financial assistance.
  Both custodial and non-custodial parents can borrow through the PLUS
  loan program in order to meet their obligation to the student's costs
  at Coe. The interest rate for loans processed during the 2021--22
  academic year is fixed at 6.28 \%. A 4.228\% origination fee is
  subtracted from the loan funds. Repayment begins 60 days after the
  loan is fully disbursed unless the borrower requests to defer payment
  while the student is enrolled.
\item
  \textbf{Federal Direct PLUS Loan Program for Graduate Students}\\
  Federal Direct PLUS Loan Program for Graduate Students must be repaid
  by the student. The terms and conditions applicable to the Parent PLUS
  Loan (made to parents of dependent students) also apply to PLUS Loans
  made to graduate students.

\subsection{General
Policies}\label{sec-financial-aid-satisfactory-academic-prgress-policy}}

\textbf{Financial Aid Satisfactory Academic Progress Policy --- Academic
Year 22--23}

\begin{verbatim}
The Student Financial Services Office is required to monitor students who receive federal financial aid to determine if they are making satisfactory academic progress (SAP) toward their degree program.

SAP standards apply to all students receiving federal, state, and institutional financial aid. These standards apply to a student’s entire degree program including terms for which financial aid was not applied or for which enrollment was less than full-time.  

SAP of federal financial aid recipients is measured each term of the academic year[^1] for which a student is enrolled. The specific criteria of SAP, and the consequences to the student if progress is not achieved, is outlined in the following SAP Policy. Students should contact the Student Financial Services with questions regarding the intent or the interpretation of these standards.

SAP is measured in three components: Cumulative Grade Point Average (GPA); Pace (Completion Rate); and Maximum Time Frame Limitation.
\end{verbatim}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}

  \textbf{GPA:} A student in an undergraduate program must meet minimum
  GPA standards.

\begin{enumerate}

\setcounter{enumi}{2}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Maximum Time Frame:} A student must complete his or her
  educational program within 150\% of the published length of the
  program measured in attempted course credits or credit hours. For
  example: the majority of undergraduate programs at Coe College require
  32 course credits for graduation. A student can receive federal
  financial aid for a maximum of 48 attempted cc (32cc x 1.5). A student
  pursuing a double major/minor or a student who changed majors will
  normally be expected to complete all degree requirements before
  reaching 150 percent of attempted cc required to complete a program.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Financial Aid Warning} A student who does not meet the minimum
SAP standards for GPA and Pace will be placed on Financial Aid Warning
for the subsequent term. Federal financial aid can be received during a
Financial Aid Warning Term. A Financial Aid Warning notice is sent to
the student by the Student Financial Services Office at the beginning of
the warning term.

\textbf{Financial Aid Suspension} A student who fails to meet SAP during
the warning term is no longer eligible to receive federal financial aid
and is placed on Financial Aid Suspension. The Student Financial
Services Office will notify the student of his or her financial aid
suspension; the notice will include information on the financial aid
appeal process.

\textbf{Financial Aid Appeal} A student may appeal his or her financial
aid suspension by completing the SAP Appeal Form. The appeal must be
submitted to the Student Financial Services Office as soon as possible
and must include an explanation of why the student failed to meet SAP
and what has changed in the student's situation that would allow him or
her to meet SAP standards during the term. Circumstances are limited and
cannot be based upon a student's need for assistance or the lack of
knowledge that financial aid assistance was in jeopardy. Examples of
possible situations include documented serious illness, severe injury,
death of a family member, or other circumstances that prevented the
student from meeting SAP standards. The Financial Aid Appeal Committee
will review the appeal and notify the student of the outcome within 14
days of the receipt of a completed Financial Aid Appeal Form. A student
whose appeal is denied will be granted a 100 percent refund of tuition
charges if they officially drop all courses.

\textbf{Financial Aid Probation} A student who successfully appeals his
or her financial aid suspension is placed on Financial Aid Probation.
Federal financial aid can be received for the term a student is on
Financial Aid Probation.

\textbf{Academic Plan} In most cases a student must complete an academic
plan. An Academic Plan is generally developed based on a student's
individual needs and is completed with Learning Commons staff. A student
whose appeal has been granted based on an Academic Plan must continually
meet the terms of the plan in order to receive federal financial aid. If
a student fails to meet the terms of the plan, the student loses
financial aid eligibility and is placed on Financial Aid Suspension.

\textbf{Regaining Eligibility when a Financial Aid Appeal has not been
granted} If a Financial Aid Probation Appeal is denied or an appeal was
never submitted, the student may regain eligibility to receive financial
aid by completing a number of courses without receiving federal
financial aid. It is the student's responsibility to contact the Student
Financial Services Office if he or she can demonstrate that SAP
standards are being met or that an academic plan has been developed
that, if followed, will ensure the student is able to meet SAP standards
by a specific point in time.

\hypertarget{impact-on-sap-of-certain-types-of-status-marks-and-credits}{%
\subsection{Impact on SAP of certain types of status marks and
credits}\label{impact-on-sap-of-certain-types-of-status-marks-and-credits}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Audited Courses} Audited courses do not count towards degree
  requirements and do not impact SAP.
\item
  \textbf{Status Mark of I} Courses for which a grade has not been
  reported at the time of the SAP evaluation will be counted as
  attempted credits. Credit is not earned and GPA is not impacted. It is
  the student's responsibility to inform the Student Financial Services
  once a grade has been reported.
\item
  \textbf{Pass (P) -- Not Pass (NP) Graded Courses} Grades of ``P''
  count as attempted credits and credits earned. Grades of ``NP'' count
  as attempted credits, but not credits earned. Grades of ``P'' and
  ``NP'' do not impact GPA.
\item
  \textbf{Transfer Credits} Courses that are transferred from another
  institution and \textbf{accepted toward a degree program} count as
  attempted and earned credits, but do not impact the cumulative GPA.
  Courses that are taken at another institution that are \textbf{not
  accepted towards a degree program} do not impact SAP standards.
\item
  \textbf{Updating Coursework} \textbf{Successfully completed courses}
  that are repeated are counted as attempted credits but not credits
  earned. The grade earned in a repeated course will replace the
  previously earned grade and may impact the cumulative GPA. A student
  must report any grade changes/updates that affect aid eligibility
  directly to the Student Financial Services Office.

  \textbf{Failed courses} that are repeated are counted as attempted and
  earned hours and therefore impact the cumulative GPA.
\item
  \textbf{Status Marks of W and WF} Courses for which a grade of ``W''
  is recorded count as attempted credits. Courses for which a grade of
  ``WF'' is recorded count as attempted credits and impact GPA.
\item
  \textbf{Part-time Students} Coe grants and scholarships are not
  available to students who are enrolled part-time (fewer than 3.0
  course credits). Federal and state grants and loans are available to
  part-time students at pro-rated amounts. Students changing their
  enrollment status from full-time to part-time must contact the Student
  Financial Services Office. To be eligible for a federal Direct
  Stafford Student loan, a student must be enrolled for a minimum of two
  course credits. Students who are enrolled for fewer than two course
  credits do not qualify for an in-school deferment status on existing
  federal loans.
\item
  \textbf{Fifth Year of Study} Financial aid beyond eight terms is
  generally limited to federal and some state aid. Students are
  encouraged to file a Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA)
  for federal and state financial aid, although both types of financial
  aid also have statutory limits. For students who received a federal
  Pell grant, the equivalent of 12 full-time terms is the maximum. For
  students receiving the Iowa Tuition Grant, eight full-time terms are
  the maximum. Federal and state financial aid eligibility ends once
  students have satisfied all requirements for their particular areas of
  study. (See Financial Aid Satisfactory Academic Progress Policy,
  Section~\ref{sec-financial-aid-satisfactory-academic-prgress-policy}
  for additional restrictions.)

  Students who received eight terms of Coe aid are not eligible for
  Coe-gift funds. However, students pursuing a fifth year of study may
  be eligible for a continuing student discount. Students who wish to
  apply for the continuing student discount should contact the Student
  Financial Services Office. Education and accounting majors who are in
  their fifth year of study may be eligible for a fifth-year tuition
  discount. Contact the respective academic departments and the Student
  Financial Services Office for more information.
\item
  \textbf{Withdrawal and Leave of Absence from the College}
\end{itemize}

When a student withdraws or takes a leave of absence from all classes
during a term, it is the responsibility of the college to calculate a
return of Title IV funds according to federal policy. (See Return of
Title IV Funds/Institutional Refund Policy,
Section~\ref{sec-federal-title-IV-refund-calculation-policy} ) Students
who are granted a leave of absence, and are not attending college
elsewhere during the leave, generally are eligible to have their
academic and talent-based scholarships renewed upon their return.
Renewal of these scholarships is contingent upon meeting Satisfactory
Academic Progress, see
Section~\ref{sec-financial-aid-satisfactory-academic-prgress-policy} .
Students who are returning from a leave of absence and have attended
college elsewhere may have their scholarship eligibility reevaluated.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Reporting Changes and Other Assistance} Any change in a
  student's enrollment status, financial circumstances, or residential
  status must be reported immediately to the Student Financial Services
  Office. Such a change may have an effect on the calculation of
  financial need and the resulting assistance offered. It is in the best
  interest of students to contact the Student Financial Services Office
  prior to an enrollment or residential status change.
\item
  \textbf{Outside Scholarships and Loans} All aid received from sources
  outside of Coe College must be reported to the Student Financial
  Services Office. Outside assistance may include, but is not limited
  to: scholarships, tuition reimbursement, private student loans, etc.
  These funds may cause a change in financial aid eligibility.
\item
  \textbf{Appeals} A student has the right to appeal any decision
  concerning financial aid eligibility or award in writing to the
  Director of Financial Aid. To do so, contact the Director of Financial
  Aid.
\item
  \textbf{Off-Campus Study} Coe-administered financial aid, with the
  exception of the National Tuition Exchange (NTE) Program benefits, may
  be used for off-campus study if approved by the Committee on
  Internationalization. Students are responsible for any additional
  costs of the programs. Applications to use Coe aid should be filed
  with the Director of Off-Campus Studies. Enrollment in an off-campus
  study program approved for credit by Coe qualifies the student to be
  considered for assistance from federal and state grant and loan
  programs. Contact the Student Financial Services Office for more
  information.
