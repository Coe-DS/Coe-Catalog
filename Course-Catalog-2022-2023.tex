The total cost of full-time tuition, room, board, and activity fee for
the 2021--2022 academic year is \$59,324.

\subsection{HISTORY OF COE COLLEGE}\label{sec-history-of-coe-college}

Coe College claims the shortest name of any American institution of
higher education, but the school has actually carried five titles
through its history. When the Rev.~Williston Jones founded the college
in 1851, he called it The School for the Prophets. Cedar Rapids' first
resident minister opened the parlor of his home to a group of young men
with the goal of educating them for the ministry to serve churches in
the Midwest. Two years later, while Jones was canvassing churches in the
East for money to send three of his students to Eastern seminaries, a
Catskills farmer named Daniel Coe stepped forward with a pledge of
\$1,500 and urged Jones to start his own college in the frontier town of
Cedar Rapids. Legend has it that the \$1,500 raised by Coe was brought
west from New York, sewn into the petticoat of a lady visitor traveling
by stagecoach to Iowa. Coe gave this generous gift with the stipulation
that the proposed institute should be ``made available for the education
of females as well as males.'' Accordingly, Coe was coeducational from
its founding.

With Jones' blessing, the Cedar Rapids Collegiate Institute was
incorporated in 1853 by a group of Cedar Rapids leaders chaired by Judge
George Greene. They used Daniel Coe's money to purchase two downtown
lots for the school and 80 acres of farmland on what was then the edge
of town. The farm evolved into today's campus. In 1868, in a failed
attempt to secure the Lewis Parsons estate, the trustees renamed the
school Parsons Seminary. After a period of severe financial
difficulties, the institution was reestablished in honor of its original
benefactor as the Coe Collegiate Institute in 1875.

T.M Sinclair, founder of the Sinclair Meat Packing Company, played the
key financial role in the final step toward the firm establishment of
Coe College. Sinclair liquidated all the debt from Parsons Seminary and
the Cedar Rapids Collegiate Institute. The Sinclair gift made it
practical for the property of the Coe Collegiate Institute---including
the original land paid for by Daniel Coe---to be transferred to Coe
College with the Iowa Presbyterian Synod to assume major responsibility
for the institution. Coe College has operated continuously since its
incorporation under that name on Feb.~2, 1881. From the first, the
College was committed to intellectual excellence. It has continued in
this tradition ever since.

The compact campus on the east edge of Cedar Rapids grew with many
building projects in its early years, including Old Main (1868),
Williston Hall (1881), Marshall Hall (1900), the first gymnasium (1904),
and the first T.M. Sinclair Memorial Chapel (1911). In 1907, Coe earned
accreditation from the North Central Association of Colleges and
Universities. Over the decades, Coe's reputation as a superior liberal
arts college has continued to grow. One recognition of this came in
1949, when Coe was granted a Phi Beta Kappa chapter, a distinction
reserved for about 10\% of American colleges and universities.

Central to the educational philosophy of Coe College is the belief that
a liberal arts education is the best preparation for life. Students have
the opportunity to experience a variety of subjects outside their
respective programs of study. Coe offers more than 40 areas of study
that cover a range of fields. The College awards the following
undergraduate degrees: Bachelor of Arts (B.A.), Bachelor of Music
(B.M.), and Bachelor of Science in Nursing (B.S.N.).

There are a number of factors that contribute to Coe College's strong
academic quality. The key to Coe's tradition of excellence in academic
quality relates directly to small class sizes and the interest shown by
professors to make learning a personalized experience. At Coe, the
average class size is 16, and the student-faculty ratio is 11:1. Classes
are taught by our involved and committed faculty, 91\% of whom hold the
highest degree in their field. This means classes are taught by
experienced professionals who have in-depth knowledge of their subjects.
To provide students with a well-rounded experience and solid preparation
for the future, Coe offers, along with quality instruction from superb
faculty, an abundance of out-of-class opportunities which include
student-faculty collaborative research, honors projects, service
learning, and internships. Within one year of graduation, according to
the annual survey results from the Center for Creativity and Careers,
98\% of Coe graduates are engaged in post-graduate activity such as
employment, graduate school, military, or travel/adventure.

With the addition of the east campus, Coe has nearly doubled in size
since 1989. New facilities on the east side of College Drive include
Athletic Recreation Center (2017), Clark Racquet Center and athletic
fields (1989), Clark Alumni House (1993), Nassif House (1999), and four
student apartment buildings (Morris House and Schlarbaum House in 2000,
Brandt House and Spivey House in 2002). McCabe Hall (2005), named in
honor of former Coe President Joseph E. McCabe, houses the offices of
the president, provost, advancement and alumni relations, and The Center
for Creativity, Careers and Community (C3) making way for the remodeling
of Coe's oldest building, Stuart Hall, and the first significant
addition of classroom space since Peterson Hall was built in the 1960s.
In 2012 and 2013, Peterson Hall of Science was completely renovated to
support Coe's science programs. To further enhance the campus
environment, Coe completed the largest capital project in its history in
2017. Make Your Move -- the Campaign for Eby and Hickok -- included \$24
million in essential enhancements, including an Athletic and Recreation
Complex project as well as the renovation and expansion of Hickok Hall,
one of the College's main academic buildings. The result is vastly
improved academic, recreational, wellness and competition facilities to
benefit future generations of students.

*Courses taught at the Wilderness Field Station are subject to the broad

\chapter{THE ACADEMIC CALENDAR}\label{the-academic-calendar}

The academic year consists of three terms (see Academic Calendar,
p.~10-11). Students normally take four course credits in the Fall Term
and four course credits in the Spring Term. Thus, eight course credits
are completed in an academic year. During optional May Term, students
may enroll for up to one course credit in one of the limited selection
of courses. Summer term is limited in scope and is not considered a
regular term. (The maximum course load is described in Course Load,
p.~41).

\chapter{MAY TERM (OPTIONAL)}\label{may-term-optional}

Students may enroll for up to one course credit during May Term in one
of the limited selection of courses. All May Term courses require
consent of instructor prior to registration. May Term courses are
designed to meet at least two of the following shared learning outcomes:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Evaluate and engage with complex interdependent systems and
  demonstrate understanding across diverse contexts.
\item
  Critically describe and break apart issues or problems through
  systematic analysis and illustrate logic for conclusions.
\item
  Engage with experiential learning practices such as learning by doing,
  while utilizing abilities to think critically, problem solve and make
  connections between knowledge gained in the classroom and experience
  beyond.
\end{itemize}

May Term courses are expected to have the same amount of contact time
and academic rigor per course credit as courses which meet over a Fall
or Spring Term.~ For every 1 course credit of May term students are
expected to complete 140 hours of work. Such contact time includes class
meetings, lectures by the instructor, supervised course related
activities and independent out of class activities.~ Off-campus May Term
courses at an off-campus location provide certain educational benefits
through site visits, guest lectures, etc., that also contribute to the
contact time for the course.

\chapter{COE PLAN}\label{sec-coe-plan}

Coe College's requirements for graduation, commonly known as the Coe
Plan were developed with the following outcomes in mind:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Creation of a bridge from high school to Coe College that helps
  students understand the importance of a liberal arts education, the
  ways to develop the skills needed by any learner, and the
  opportunities they will have by going to Coe College.
\item
  Development of required curriculum that exposes the students to ways
  of learning in various contexts, big ideas in a myriad of disciplines,
  ways of being and understanding of cultures around the world, and
  processes to develop the skills needed by any learner.
\item
  Creation of a bridge from Coe College to life after Coe.
\end{itemize}

These outcomes are met through the College's First-Year Experience,
General Education program, Writing Emphasis courses, and the College's
Practicum experiences and areas of study, described in this section of
the Catalog.

\chapter{GRADUATION REQUIREMENTS}\label{sec-graduation-requirements}

All students who graduate from Coe College must complete at least one
major and earn at least 32 course credits (cc) with grades leading to a
cumulative grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 or higher. (The course is
the unit of academic credit.) Courses are one credit unless otherwise
indicated. Students are expected to complete 180 hours of work to earn
one course credit, although class times vary from course to course.
Other institutions may convert Coe credit to their system by considering
one course credit to be 6 quarter hours, or 4 semester hours.) No more
than a total of two course credits from courses which are less than 0.5
credit can be used to meet the 32-credit graduation requirement. No more
than eight course credits earned of Advanced Placement or International
Baccalaureate credit can be used to satisfy this requirement.

Students must meet one of the following requirements:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Complete at least the final academic year of required courses
  registered through Coe.
\item
  Earn a total of 16 course credits or the equivalent at Coe. The last
  eight course credits needed for graduation must include at least four
  earned at Coe. Approved off-campus study programs and internships can
  be used to fulfill this requirement.
\end{itemize}

A student may be simultaneously awarded two degrees (B.A., B.M., B.S.N.)
after satisfactorily completing 40 course credits and the requirements
for both degrees. However, a simultaneous Bachelor of Music plus a
Bachelor of Arts with a music major is not permitted.

In addition, students must fulfill the requirements of the First-Year
Experience, General Education, Writing Emphasis, and Practicum.

To participate in Commencement exercises, students must submit a
completed Intent to Graduate form to the Office of the Registrar,
preferably three terms prior to Commencement.

\section{Second Baccalaureate Degree}\label{second-baccalaureate-degree}

A student who holds a baccalaureate degree from another institution may
earn a second baccalaureate degree at Coe, if the following criteria are
met:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The first degree must be from a regionally accredited institution as
  recognized by the US Department of Education, or another appropriate
  accrediting body.
\item
  The first degree must be completed (not in progress) before beginning
  the second degree at Coe.
\end{itemize}

Students accepted at Coe to pursue a second degree are granted a maximum
of 24 course credits in transfer credit towards the 32 course credits
required for graduation. To graduate, at least eight course credits must
be earned at Coe College and all requirements for the major area of
study must be met with at least 40\% of the major course credits taken
at Coe. Students must earn a cumulative GPA of at least 2.0 as well as
meet any GPA or grade requirements in their area of study.

Second baccalaureate students are exempt from the following
requirements: first-year experience, general education, writing
emphasis, and practicum. They are not eligible to graduate with Latin
Honors or for induction in Phi Beta Kappa or Phi Kappa Phi.

\section{Transfer Student
Information}\label{transfer-student-information}

To honor its mission and to preserve its academic integrity as a liberal
arts institution, the College accepts a course in transfer if that
course meets the spirit of the College's mission and is from a
regionally accredited institution. This section includes information, in
addition to that included in the section, Graduation Requirements (see
p.~13), germane to students who are transferring to Coe College from
another college or university.

Courses transferred to Coe can, as approved by the Registrar, fulfill
some graduation requirements. From institutions on a semester hour
system (at Coe, 1 course credit = 4 semester hours), only courses with
three or more semester hours can be used to fulfill any major or general
education requirements. From institutions on other than a semester hour
system, only courses equivalent to at least 0.75 course credits can be
used to fulfill any major or general education requirement. In some
cases, in consultation with the Registrar, multiple courses within the
same field may be used to fulfill one requirement.

Transfer credits earned after high-school graduation and before Coe
matriculation count towards the eight term, full-time residence
requirement (see p.~211). Full-time enrollment may include participation
in Coe College exchange programs, ACM off-campus study programs, and
other approved off-campus study programs.

All students must complete at Coe at least 40\% of the total course
credits required for each declared major or minor or three course
credits, whichever is greater. In addition to completing at least one
major area of study, transfer students must abide with the following to
complete the requirements for graduation:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  First-Year Experience. Transfer students are not required to fulfill
  the requirements of the First-Year Experience, if they have completed
  at least one full-time college term since graduation from high school.
\item
  Writing Emphasis. (See Writing Emphasis Courses, p.~16).
\item
  General Education. Requirements include Liberal Arts selections in the
  four divisional areas (Natural and Mathematical Sciences, Social
  Sciences, Humanities, Fine Arts) and Diverse Cultural Perspectives
  courses. Any courses accepted in transfer for at least 0.75 course
  credit that fit the criteria of the Liberal Arts and/or Diverse
  Cultural Perspectives core groups can be applied towards the general
  education requirements as determined by the Registrar. Advanced
  Placement and International Baccalaureate courses may not be used to
  meet any part of the General Education requirements.
\item
  Academic Practicum. Transfer students are required to fulfill this
  requirement.
\end{itemize}

\chapter{AREAS OF STUDY}\label{sec-areas-of-study}

\chapter{ACADEMIC ADVISING}\label{sec-academic-advising}

The role of the academic advisor is to acquaint students with their
academic options at Coe and assist them in selecting courses that
reflect individual interests and abilities. Advisors also help students
create a four-year education plan that allows students to make
connections between disparate areas of study, and between academic,
co-curricular, and non-academic areas. Students may change advisors at
any time upon request to the Registrar.

First-Year Seminar instructors serve as the primary academic advisors
for first-year students in their respective sections. Students thus see
their advisors frequently during their first term at Coe and have the
opportunity to work closely with them in developing overall programs of
study and long-range goals. After the first term, students may decide to
choose departmental faculty for academic advising or they may continue
to be advised by their First-Year Seminar instructors. Students are free
to speak at any time with professors in their major departments to
answer specific questions regarding requirements and courses in those
departments.

\chapter{FIRST-YEAR EXPERIENCE}\label{sec-first-year-experience}

The student's First-Year Experience at Coe is a deliberate strategy to
engage first-year students across multiple dimensions of college life in
the first year. Components of the First-Year Experience include writing
exercises, various campus events, and the First-Year Seminar (FYS).

The First-Year Seminar is required for all students who have not yet
completed a full-time college term after high school graduation. During
the Fall Term, a variety of First-Year Seminars---topics courses
exploring issues from multiple perspectives---are offered. The seminars
emphasize critical thinking, writing, speaking and research skills.

All First-Year Seminars carry the writing emphasis designation.
First-Year Seminar courses cannot fulfill any distributional, cultural
perspective, or major requirements. Students who drop or fail their
First-Year Seminar are required to complete a replacement course
designated by the Registrar the following term. The completion of this
Spring Term course makes it possible for the student to fulfill the FYS
graduation requirement. For students who fail the Fall Term First-Year
Seminar, successful completion of the Spring Term course also allows the
grade in the FYS to be changed from ``F'' to ``NP'' on the transcript.

Students who begin their college enrollment in the Spring Term must also
complete a course designated as a replacement.

\chapter{WRITING EMPHASIS COURSES}\label{sec-writing-emphasis-courses}

\textbf{Writing Across the Curriculum: Statement of Guiding Principles}

As stated in the Coe College Mission Statement, our reason to exist as
an institution is to ready students intellectually, professionally, and
socially to lead productive and satisfying lives in the global society
of the 21st century. In accordance with this mission, our curriculum
requires that students undertake ``a series of intensive writing
experiences, spread across four years of study.'' This requirement is
known as Writing Across the Curriculum, the guiding principles of which
are detailed below.

As a philosophy, Writing Across the Curriculum asserts that writing is
most effectively learned in context: to varied audiences, with varied
purposes. In adopting this philosophy, Coe College has committed to
making writing-intensive experiences available to students in all
disciplines. Known as ``Writing Emphasis'' credits, these courses are
divergent in subject matter but aligned in their commitment to giving
students content-rich and context-specific writing experiences that
foster a critical flexibility in transferring knowledge about effective
writing to multiple, even unknown, contexts.

Therefore, students who complete the requisite number of writing
emphasis courses will graduate from Coe knowing that writing is both a
means and an end: a method for exploring ideas and deepening one's
knowledge as well as a tool for sharing that knowledge and expressing
one's point of view. Similarly, graduating students will know that the
practice of writing is a recursive process rooted in revision, which
refers both to the reconsideration of one's ideas and to the refinement
of prose, and this process unfolds over a lifetime. Understanding that
students will encounter innumerable writing situations in their lives,
many of which may be unfamiliar to them, they will graduate from Coe
having developed the confidence and self-efficacy necessary to adapt or
draw from their existing knowledge in order to navigate new contexts.

Although many courses at Coe may include writing activities, courses
endorsed by Writing Across the Curriculum are those in which:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Students are given opportunities to practice revision, whether via
  multiple drafts of a single project or multiple iterations of the same
  type of assignment;
\item
  Students receive instructor feedback on written work to facilitate
  revision; and
\item
  Writing assignments are frequent enough that they are integral to the
  learning throughout the course, enabling students to develop in one or
  more of the following learning outcomes, as appropriate to discipline
  and course objectives:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    \textbf{How to write for specific purposes and audiences}

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      \emph{Including attention to the ways purposes and audiences shape
      form, mode, voice, method, organization, engagement with and
      citation of research, and/or creativity and imagination}
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    \textbf{How to engage in critical thinking}

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      \emph{Particularly how to conduct analysis, how to synthesize
      information, how to interpret and/or use evidence and data, and
      how to present one's ideas coherently and stylistically}
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    \textbf{How to practice, assess, and develop effective habits for
    writing}

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      \emph{Specifically, how to read deeply, how to begin and later
      practice selection in research, how to be a skilled reader of
      one's own and others' in-process writing, how to accept and
      interpret feedback, and how to revise writing, all of which are
      parts of the process of learning how to have and develop ideas}
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    \textbf{How to engage in writing as a method for learning and
    discovery}

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      \emph{For deepening knowledge, thinking through questions and
      problems, and reflecting on connections and growth}
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    \textbf{How to name and describe one's own knowledge for others}

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      \emph{For example, in the form of personal statements for
      application to graduate study, cover letters and resumes for
      entering and advancing in the workforce, or other forms of
      self-summary that facilitate transition from the baccalaureate
      environment through the broader public.}
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Many writing emphasis sections are offered each year, and, in addition,
the College's rhetoric department offers several interdisciplinary
writing courses designed to guide students learning to write effectively
at the college level. (See course descriptions starting on p.~49).
General Education or major courses that are also designated as writing
emphasis courses may be used to satisfy both requirements.

In this catalog, writing emphasis courses are designated by a (WE) after
the course title, e.g.~``RHE-200 Rhetorical Theory \& Practice (WE).''
In other contexts, the course code may end with a ``W''
(e.g.~RHE-200-W). All sections of such a course, regardless of
instructor, will carry writing emphasis credit.

Fulfilling the Writing Emphasis Requirement:

Only designated WE courses in which a student earns a grade of ``C''
(2.0) or better count toward fulfillment of this requirement.

Only designated courses taken at Coe College count toward fulfillment of
this requirement.

Undergraduate degree-seeking* students

\begin{itemize}
\item
  who start at Coe College or who transfer fewer than 8 course credits
  earned after graduation from high school must complete at least 5
  writing emphasis courses. Of these 5, one will usually be the FYS. Of
  the remaining 4, it is recommended (but not required) that at least 1
  be taken outside the student's intended major(s).
\item
  who transfer at least 8 but fewer than 16 course credits to Coe,
  earned after graduation from high school, must complete at least 3
  writing emphasis courses.
\item
  who transfer 16 or more course credits to Coe, earned after graduation
  from high school, must complete at least 2 writing emphasis credits.
\end{itemize}

For all students, regardless of transfer credit, it is recommended (but
not required) that at least one writing emphasis course be taken in the
upper division within the student's intended major(s). ``Upper
division'' courses are defined in this case as those numbered 300 and
above; upper division writing emphasis courses could include both
scheduled classroom courses and arranged writing-based capstone projects
(such as a thesis). See Departmental Writing Plans for more information
on writing in the major(s).

*Students seeking a second undergraduate degree from Coe should see
Second Baccalaureate Degree p.~13.

\subsubsection{COURSE NUMBERING}\label{course-numbering}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Courses numbered 100--199 are introductory to the subject.
\item
  Courses numbered 200--299 assume a capacity for the independent
  acquisition of material and generally build on the methods and subject
  matter of 100-level courses.
\item
  Courses numbered 300--399 are typically oriented toward a major or
  minor. They require a strong foundation of knowledge specific to the
  discipline.
\item
  Courses numbered 400--499 are courses in the major or minor that are
  designed to challenge students to integrate discipline-specific
  knowledge in advanced ways. These courses typically contain advanced
  disciplinary coursework, capstone projects, and/or independent
  research.
\end{itemize}

\chapter{GENERAL EDUCATION COURSES}\label{sec-general-education-courses}

Completion of the General Education Program, described here, is required
for all students earning B.A. or B.S.N. degree at Coe College, but not
required of students earning a B.M. degree. An appropriate transferred
course, determined by the Office of the Registrar, with a grade of ``C''
(2.0) or better may be accepted to meet an individual requirement.\\
Advanced Placement and International Baccalaureate courses may not be
used to meet any part of this requirement. No more than two courses with
the same prefix may be used to fulfill the General Education Core
Requirements.

\textbf{A) Liberal Arts Core}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  A total of at least one course credit in the \textbf{Fine Arts Core}
  (courses with a prefix of ARH, ART, FLM, MU, MUA, THE)
\item
  A total of at least two course credits in the \textbf{Humanities Core}
  (courses with a prefix of AAM, AMS, CLA, COM, CRW, ENG, FRE, GER, GRK,
  HIS, HUM, LTN, JPN, PHL, REL, RHE, or SPA)
\item
  A total of at least two course credits in the \textbf{Natural Sciences
  and Mathematics Core} (courses with a prefix of BIO, CHM, CS, DS, MTH,
  PHY, STA, one of which must be a lab science with a prefix of BIO,
  CHM, or PHY)
\item
  A total of at least two course credits in the \textbf{Social Sciences
  Core} (courses with a prefix of ANT, ECO, POL, PSY, or SOC)
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{B) Diverse Cultural Perspectives (DCP) Core}

A liberally educated person should have some knowledge of other cultures
and some tools to aid in seeing one's own culture from other
perspectives.

The Diverse Cultural Perspectives courses (Non-Western Perspectives
(course number ends in 6), United States Pluralism (course number ends
in 7), Diverse Western Perspectives (course number ends in 8) help
students to understand their own cultural identities and to develop
appreciation for the range of different cultures to be found in the
world, in the nation, and on campus. These courses explore other
cultures in their own terms and as they interact with American culture.
As a group, they encourage reflection on different ways in which
cultural identities are formed, expressed and contested. Students are
encouraged to combine these courses with the study of a world language
and with study abroad.

Completion of one of the following options (see p.~19-21 for
descriptions and approved courses):

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Non-World Language Option (all of the following):

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Any DCP course (course number that ends in 6, 7, 8)
  \item
    Non-Western Perspectives (course number that ends in 6) (A
    semester-long study abroad experience can fulfill the Non-Western
    Perspective and DCP requirement.)
  \item
    United States Pluralism (course number that ends in 7) (A
    semester-long U.S. off-campus study experience can fulfill the U.S.
    Pluralism and DCP requirement.)
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Elementary World Language Option (all of the following):

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Any DCP course (course number that ends in 6, 7, 8)

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Any DCP course (course number that ends in 6, 7, or 8)
  \item
    One intermediate (-215) or above World Language course (\emph{may
    also fulfill one of the Humanities Core course requirements})
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Diverse Cultural Perspectives: Non-Western
Perspectives}\label{sec-diverse-cultural-perspectives-non-western}

The Non-Western Perspectives (NWP) group includes courses in which a
preponderance of the content analyzes human experience from the
perspectives of diverse peoples outside of Western culture. Such
cultures often are characterized by values and beliefs different from
those of the United States and Western Europe.

\section{Diverse Cultural Perspectives: United States
Pluralism}\label{sec-diverse-cultural-perspectives-united-states}

The United States Pluralism (USP) group includes courses in which a
preponderance of the content addresses one or more of the groups within
the United States whose values, beliefs, and experiences differ from or
oppose those of the majority culture. These courses increase students'
knowledge of the history of such groups; of the ways members of these
groups have experienced democracy and culture in America differently
because of factors like social class, race, gender, and religion; and of
reform movements like feminism and civil rights, through which such
groups have attempted to achieve social and economic equality.

\section{Diverse Cultural Perspectives: Diverse Western
Perspectives}\label{sec-diverse-cultural-perspectives-western}

The Diverse Western Perspectives (DWP) group includes courses in which a
preponderance of the content addresses one or more subgroups of the
Western world outside of the United States and the ways in which they
experience Western culture. These courses increase students' knowledge
of the history of particular groups and the ways they have interacted
with Western values. They typically address issues of difference and
conflict between and within Western cultures by examining the influence
of factors such as class, race, gender, and religion.

\section{Independent Studies}\label{sec-independent-studies}

The one-credit independent study or directed readings students are
expected to complete a minimum of 140 hours of academic work, including
meeting with faculty members and independent work between meetings.

\section{Internships}\label{sec-internships}

The internship is a work or volunteer experience in the context of an
independent academic investigation of site-related issues and personal
aptitudes, values, and goals. The one-credit internship includes a
minimum of 140 hours of on-site or remote experience and the required
documentation and/or academic journal or paper as determined by the
faculty member. The details of the academic component are determined by
prior arrangement with the faculty internship advisor.

Ordinarily internships are completed during the academic year as one of
the 32 credits for graduation, or over the summer for a credit-bearing
or non-credit bearing-practicum fulfillment activity. In unusual
circumstances where an internship presents an opportunity to extend the
educational component of the experience significantly, an internship may
earn two credits. Application for non-departmental, two-credit
internships requires consultation with the Internship Faculty Advisor
and approval of the Committee on Petitions; departmental two-credit
internships, when permitted, are overseen by the department.

A combined maximum of 2.0 course credits may be counted toward the 32
credits required for graduation through Internships or Community-Based
Project (see p.~49). Many internships are completed in the Cedar Rapids
area; however, it is permissible to complete an internship outside of
the area during the summer, or done remotely if authorized by the
Internship Faculty Advisor.

Students interested in internships should consult with their Career
Specialist in C3: Creativity, Careers, Community, as well as with the
appropriate academic department who will be overseeing the internship
experience.

Each internship must include the consent of an Internship Faculty
Advisor and completion of the internship request form housed on the
College's online platform for internships.

\section{Practicum}\label{sec-practicum}

A practicum experience is required of all students for all undergraduate
degrees, except those earning second degrees.

Typically completed in the student's junior or senior year, all practica
are experiences that integrate academic components with career or other
life goals and are significant educational exercises outside the
classroom. A practicum experience can consist of an internship,
off-campus study, community-based project, honors project, or some other
kind of independent activity.

Depending upon the type selected, some practica are graded A--F, while
others are P/NP. Some practica are credit bearing, while others are not.
In some instances, the practicum must be approved by the student's major
department.

\section{Cross-Registration with Mount Mercy
University}\label{cross-registration-with-mount-mercy-university}

This agreement:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Covers only courses that are not offered at Coe College in the same
  term unless a time conflict exists that cannot be resolved.
\item
  Is permitted on a space-available basis two weeks after the regular
  registration at Mount Mercy.
\item
  Holds students subject to administrative rules of the host institution
  for the courses taken.
\item
  Requires the student to register at both institutions.
\item
  Requires that a student be full-time and degree seeking in the term of
  the request and for at least one previous term at Coe College.
\end{enumerate}

Coe students wishing to enroll at Mount Mercy University may not be on
academic probation (see p.~43) and may not have been dismissed from Coe
College. Prior to registering, students must submit a cross-registration
request form to the Registrar, who grants approval to students wishing
to register at Mount Mercy University. If the course is to be counted
toward a major or minor, the approval of the appropriate Coe department
chair is also required. Declarations of Pass/Not Pass options are made
at Coe according to Coe policies. Both course credit and the letter
grade given at Mount Mercy are recorded in the student's permanent
record, as well as the fact that the course was taught at Mount Mercy.
Under the agreement no additional fees are charged for cross
registration, although the sum of the credits registered at both
institutions are used to determine full-time status and/or the need to
petition to take 5.0 course credits or more.

A cross-registered student missing a class at a cooperating college
because of calendar differences shall not be penalized for missing the
class. The student, however, is responsible for making up any work
missed in the class. Before registering for a course at Mount Mercy
under this agreement, a student must complete the Mount Mercy--Coe
College Cross Registration Form to be processed to ensure that all
stipulations of the agreement are met.

\section{English As A Second Language

\section{Pre-Professional Programs}\label{pre-professional-programs}

\subsection{Pre-Law}\label{pre-law}

J. Christensen (Program Director).

The cooperative 3+3 program allows qualified undergraduates from Coe
College to earn both a bachelor's degree and a law degree in six years
through partnership with the University of Iowa College of Law.

If eligible, students admitted under the 3+3 program will receive three
years of financial aid and pay Coe College tuition for the first three
years. Qualified undergraduates from Coe must have satisfied all
graduation requirements with the exception of the 32-course credit
requirement by the conclusion of their junior year for admission into
the College of Law. Students are not eligible for campus housing or
extracurricular activities at Coe during their fourth year. During the
fourth year of the program, which is the first year of law school,
students will pay tuition only to Iowa Law and apply for financial aid
through the University of Iowa. Credits earned during the first year of
law school at Iowa, which would have been their senior year at Coe, will
also apply to their undergraduate degree to complete the final credit
requirements at Coe. At the end of their fourth year of study, students
in the program will receive their bachelor's degree from Coe College,
while also having a year of law school completed at the University of
Iowa College of Law.

There is no prescribed curriculum for students intending to enter law
school after graduation. Law schools report that their most successful
students are those who have acquired a broad academic background in the
liberal arts, developed a capacity for logical analysis, and mastered
the ability to write clearly.

Study in one or several of a variety of disciplines will prepare
students to undertake legal training. Students interested in law should
consult their department advisor and the pre-law program director.

\subsection{Health Professions}\label{health-professions}

Storer (Program Director).

Coe's program for those interested in the health professions, such as
medicine and dentistry, is a flexible one based on the requirements of
the health professions' schools. Students interested in a health
profession usually major in one of the sciences, but all majors offered
by the College are acceptable.

\subsection{Professional School Degree Completion
Plan}\label{professional-school-degree-completion-plan}

Students who complete three years of coursework at Coe (24 course
credits), including general education and area of study requirements,
and who enter a college of architecture, engineering, or a physical
therapy program, can receive a baccalaureate degree from Coe. Required
for satisfactory completion of this program are (1) approval of the
program by the Provost and Dean of the Faculty before transferring to
the professional institution and (2) one year of full-time acceptable
study there.

\subsection{Cooperative Degree Program With The University Of Iowa's
College Of Public
Health}\label{cooperative-degree-program-with-the-university-of-iowas-college-of-public-health}

This combined undergraduate and graduate 5-year program allows students
to earn a Bachelor of Arts degree from Coe College and a Master of
Public Health (MPH) degree from the University of Iowa. This program is
available to students electing any undergraduate major offered by Coe.
The first four years in the program are spent in residence at Coe
College. Interested students take one University of Iowa undergraduate
course in the spring of their second year (\emph{Fundamentals of Public
Health}). In their third year, students take the GRE and apply to the
Master's program in Public Health. If accepted, the student completes up
to four graduate-level MPH courses during the fourth year at Coe College
(\emph{Introduction to Biostatistics, Introduction to Health Promotion
and Disease Prevention, Global Environmental Health, and/or
Epidemiology}). UI Public Health courses are accepted in transfer to Coe
College as elective credit.

\chapter{OFF-CAMPUS STUDY}\label{off-campus-study}

The College endorses a wide variety of off-campus experiences for
students. Coe strongly believes that students can benefit from study in
Washington, New York, and the Wilderness Field Station, as well as in
programs around the world.

Numerous domestic and international study programs are available to Coe
students. The four programs sponsored by Coe College are Asia Term, New
York Term, Washington Term and Wilderness Field Station courses. In
addition, programs are offered by the Associated Colleges of the Midwest
(ACM) and others, including several exchange programs, by colleges,
universities, and educational agencies in America and abroad. Students
who wish to study off-campus on Coe's sponsored programs must apply to
the individual program's director. Student proposals to study on
exchange programs must be submitted to the Director of Off-Campus
Studies at least six weeks before the end of the term just prior to the
off-campus experience. Student proposals to study on all other
off-campus programs must be submitted to the Director of Off-Campus
Studies by the last day of classes of Fall Term of the academic year
prior to the program.

Credits earned on off-campus programs are applied toward graduation on
the same basis as credits earned on campus. Any academic credit earned
from programs not sponsored by Coe may be transferred back to the
College in accordance with the College's general policy on transfer
credit. Application is open to sophomores, juniors, and seniors who have
a minimum 2.25 GPA at both the time of application and of enrollment for
the off-campus study.

NOTE: \emph{International students may not receive Coe College financial
aid for off-campus study outside the U.S.}

enjoy a variety of cultural activities in the fine arts. (See p.~75 for
descriptions and course offerings.)

\subsection{Wilderness Field Station}\label{wilderness-field-station}

Ellis (Program Director).

The Coe College Wilderness Field Station, located on remote Low Lake in
Minnesota's Superior National Forest, offers students a unique and
unparalleled opportunity for off-campus study. Courses take advantage of
the serene surroundings for field observation, wilderness study, and
outdoor learning. Biology courses are at the heart of the field station
and often include aquatic biology, animal behavior, ornithology, and
behavioral ecology of vertebrates. Students use the base camp's
laboratories, herbarium, and library to supplement their field work.
Non-science electives, such as nature writing and wilderness and the
law, are also offered. There is an independent study option as well.
Participants take one course during a four-week session.

The program runs from mid-June to mid-July, mid-July to mid-August, or
both. Each course is limited to eight students. Each course offered at
the field station is one course credit. Particular courses satisfy lab
science and other general education requirements and can be used as
major elective credits. Any course taken at the field station satisfies
the College's practicum requirement. The regular application deadline is
March 1st; the final deadline is April 15th, with rolling applications
after that date. For more information and application materials, visit

Studies in Tokyo after a brief orientation providing intensive language
practice and cultural discussions. In addition to required language
study, electives may be chosen from a wide range of Asian studies
courses taught in English. A family living experience in Tokyo provides
an informal education in Japanese culture and is in many ways the
dominant feature of the program, offering total immersion in the
Japanese way of life. The program is recommended for a full year of
study, although students usually cannot receive Coe gift aid for more
than one term. The full-year program includes a month-long cultural
practicum or internship in another region of Japan, usually in February
or March. Administered by Earlham College, Japan Study is recognized by
both ACM and GLCA. Learn more at

of the world's great research libraries. They join ACM and GLCA faculty
members in close reading and discussion centered on a common theme, and
then write a major paper on a topic of their choice, using the Newberry
Library's rich collections of primary documents. The Fall Seminar runs
for a full term; the Spring Seminars are month-long. Students live in
Chicago apartments and take advantage of the city's rich resources. The
Newberry Seminar is for students looking for an academic challenge, a
chance to do independent work, and possibly planning to attend graduate

(ORNL) near Knoxville, Tennessee. The majority of a student's time is
spent in research with an advisor specializing in biology, engineering,
mathematics, or the physical or social sciences. Students also
participate in an interdisciplinary seminar designed to broaden their
exposure to developments in their major field and related disciplines.
In addition, each student chooses an elective from a variety of advanced
courses. The academic program is enriched in informal ways by guest
speakers, departmental colloquia, and the special interests and
expertise of the ORNL staff. Administered by Denison University, Oak
Ridge Science Semester is recognized by both ACM and GLCA. Learn more at

for off-campus study. Usually offered in the Spring Term, this program
provides students an opportunity to experience a variety of Asian
cultures in such countries as Thailand, Vietnam, and Cambodia. At each
site, students study language, read works in English about the culture,
engage in service learning, and work with students at the host
universities to gain a functional understanding of how each culture
works. Students are accompanied to Asia by Coe faculty members.

Students take four credits of coursework, typically one credit of Asian
Tonal Languages, one credit of Asian studies, and two credits of
independent study. In some iterations of the program, students take an
elective course in art, English, history, sociology, education, or
another discipline, depending on the field of the instructor leading the
program, and one credit of independent study. (See p.~70 for
descriptions and course offerings.)

\section{Exchange programs}\label{exchange-programs}

Coe College sponsors a number of programs with cooperating foreign

recommended students are sent to the host institution, with the host
reserving the right to admit or reject each student nominated.

Any student who applies for one of these programs must have completed at
least one year of continuous study at their home institution. Students
may apply to any appropriate academic program offered at the host
institution as full-time, non-degree seeking, or unclassified students.
Any academic credit earned at the host institution is transferred back
to the home institution in accordance with the rules of that
institution. The length of stay may not exceed one academic year. Upon
completion of the time period specified at the host institution, the
participating students must return to their home institution. Any
extension of stay must be approved by both cooperating institutions. The
exchange student must abide by all rules and regulations of the host
institution.

An exchange student must register and pay tuition and required fees at

other assistance to the incoming students from Coe College. Please see
individual program descriptions for information regarding housing costs.
The host institution assists in finding housing on the foreign
university campus; Coe College assists in finding residence housing for
students from the foreign university. At the end of the school year, the
host institution submits to the home institution and official
transcripts of grades and credits earned. Grades from exchange programs
transfer to Coe as P/NP.

Beyond tuition and fees, the participating student is responsible for

\subsection{Libraries}\label{libraries}

The College libraries---Stewart Memorial Library, located at the center
of the campus and Fisher Music Library in Marquis Hall---contain over
500,000 volumes and 16,000 pieces of media. Current subscriptions to
some 3,500 periodicals and serials are maintained in print or electronic
format, and over 200,000 electronic resources with books and journal
volumes added annually.

The collections ably support undergraduate education and are especially
strong in the areas of literature, history, and music. The Fisher Music
Library contains over 5,000 compact discs and records, 5,300 scores and
books, and is equipped with listening facilities. Media services to the
campus are provided through the Media Technologies Department in the
library. These services include a circulating collection of over 8,000
DVDs, two media-equipped auditorium styled classrooms, editing stations,
an innovation studio that houses a 3D printer and laser cutter, and a
variety of cameras, recording equipment available for use.

The main library houses the Learning Commons (see description below) and
the college archives. The library provides an outstanding research
collection consisting of both print and electronic books, journals, and
reference resources. The Reference Department assists students with
their research needs through one on one research assistance, evaluating
resources and websites, citation assistance and multimedia evaluation.
In addition to library orientations, research classes are offered on
specific course related topics. The library offers computer stations,
iPad and laptop checkouts, study areas for individual and group study,
including technology enhanced study rooms. These resources are greatly
augmented by providing access to over 100 scholarly databases and an
extensive webpage: coe.edu/library.

The George T. Henry College Archives includes a research room and a
climate-controlled vault located on the lower level of the Stewart
Memorial Library. It houses and preserves the institutional records of
Coe College and the papers of staff, students, and alumni of the
college. Archive staff is available to aid students, faculty, and
scholars in navigation and use of more than 900 linear feet of primary
source documents. The Archives maintains the papers of journalist,
author, and World War II broadcaster William L. Shirer, Coe class of
1925 author of \emph{The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich}; the literary
works and selected private papers of Iowa poet Paul Engle, Coe class of
1931; and the photographs of longtime Coe College photographer George T.
Henry.

\subsection{Learning Commons}\label{learning-commons}

The Coe Learning Commons in the Stewart Memorial Library integrates all
of the College's academic support resources in a single location at the
heart of campus delivered through peer education and by professional
staff. Services and resources include academic coaching, supplemental
advising, Writing Center, AAP-TRIO program, tutoring, accessibility
support and accommodations, academic technology, Office of Off-Campus

\subsection{Art Collections}\label{art-collections}

Selections from the College's Permanent Collection of Art totaling over
800 works by 200 artists are displayed in and near many of the campus
buildings. Most visible are the large outdoor sculptures on the campus,
yet almost every building features selections from the Permanent
Collection.~ For example, the Ella Poe Burling collection of
nineteenth-century American and French art and antiques is exhibited in
the upper lobby of Voorhees Hall.

A large portion of the Permanent Collection can be found in Stewart
Memorial Library.~ Four special galleries contain works by renowned
American painters Grant Wood, Marvin Cone (Coe class of 1914), and
Conger Metcalf (Coe class of 1936). Six large farm murals by Grant Wood
constitute the heart of the Permanent Collection's Regionalist works.
These murals are supplemented by nine smaller yet significant works by
Wood, including \emph{Daughters of Revolution}, a charcoal, pastel, and
pencil on paper drawing of Wood's painting of the same name.

Another signature feature of the Regionalist collection is the work of
Marvin Cone. A 1914 Coe graduate, Cone later became a faculty member who
founded the College's Art Department. Cone personally selected many of
the paintings and drawings in the collection as representative of his
own artistic development, underscoring the historic role of art as a
core element in Coe's teaching mission.

In addition to the works by native Iowans Cone and Wood, Coe College has
acquired a distinguished collection of 70 works by Conger Metcalf, an
American modernist painter, as well as paintings, drawings, and prints
by notable artists such as Milton Avery, Mauricio Lasansky, Henri
Matisse, Pablo Picasso, and Andy Warhol.

More information about the Permanent Collection can be found on either

addition to hearing speakers of national and international note,
students may have the opportunity to talk with them during a carry tray
lunch, to attend special issues dinners with the speakers, or to have
them as guests in a class. Performing groups appearing as
artists-in-residence often stay two or three days on campus to work with
students.

\subsubsection{Marquis Lecture \& Performance
Series}\label{marquis-lecture-performance-series}

The Marquis Lecture \& Performance Series hosts performances and
presentations throughout the academic year. The Marquis Series is
endowed by a gift from Sarah Marquis, Coe class of 1918, in honor of her
father, John A. Marquis, who was president of Coe from 1909 to 1919.

\subsubsection{Coe College Contemporary Issues
Forum}\label{coe-college-contemporary-issues-forum}

The Coe College Contemporary Issues Forum brings to audiences of the
College community the presence and

views of distinguished professionals whose work has received national
recognition. The forum is normally presented during the month of
February.

\subsubsection{Phi Beta Kappa Visiting
Scholar}\label{phi-beta-kappa-visiting-scholar}

The Coe chapter of Phi Beta Kappa sponsors a Phi Beta Kappa Visiting
Scholar who, in addition to presenting a public lecture, meets with
individual classes as appropriate to the scholar's area of expertise.

\chapter{STUDENT LIFE}\label{student-life}

Student Life provides personalized support to students, enabling each to
gain the best possible undergraduate education adding substantially to
the educational program. Residence accommodations, along with living and
learning values, an attractive campus social life, a sound health
program, good recreational facilities, and a program of co-curricular
activities are among the opportunities offered Student Life.

\subsection{Campus Civility Statement}\label{campus-civility-statement}

This statement was written by students in order to address standards of
civility and respect within the Coe College community. This statement is
a living document and is intended to evolve over time.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  We, the members of the Coe College community, expect our campus
  climate to be safe, mutually supportive, academically encouraging,
  egalitarian, and tolerant of all its members.
\item
  We expect the academic experience to extend beyond the classroom into
  our living environment.
\item
  We expect a campus free of incidents that create a hostile living
  environment.
\item
  We expect a healthy and responsible attitude to accompany all social
  gatherings.
\item
  We expect that intoxication will not be an excuse for incidents that
  occur while under the influence.
\item
  We expect that diversity of opinion should be cultivated and
  encouraged as well as respected within our community.
\item
  We expect that everyone will have the right to be respected for his or
  her individuality.
\item
  We expect all campus community members to respect the rights of other
  persons regardless of their actual or perceived age, color, creed,
  disability, gender identity, national origin, race, religion, sex, or
  sexual orientation.
\end{itemize}

A community is made up of individuals who model these standards and hold
each other accountable. In order for the community to encompass the
goals outlined above, each individual must be responsible and
accountable for her or his own actions and words.

\subsection{Student Contribution to College
Policy}\label{student-contribution-to-college-policy}

Coe is proud of its traditions and its ability to change. While
cognizant of the past, the College is also sensitive to the changing
nature and needs of students. Coe students play an integral part in the
initiation of change by utilizing available channels and by the creative
development and use of new ones. The Student Senate is a frequent forum
for the resolution of student concerns.

\subsection{Student Senate}\label{student-senate}

Student Senate is the representative government of Coe students and
coordinates many co-curricular activities. Through the student activity
fee, the Senate funds the weekly newspaper, the Cosmos, and other
student publications. The Student Activities Committee (SAC) of the
Student Senate sponsors bands, comedians, multicultural programming, and
other kinds of entertainment and activities.

\subsection{Student Handbook}\label{student-handbook}

The \emph{College Policies and Student Handbook} outlines the College's
expectations for responsible behavior reflecting maturity, mutual
respect, and cooperation among all members of the Coe community. Student
Life develops policies for conduct procedures, residence hall living,
student organizations, and other areas of student affairs for approval
by the Board of Trustees. The College Policies and Student Handbook is
available online at
https://www.coe.edu/student-life/student-development/college-policies-student-handbook.

\subsection{Committee Participation}\label{committee-participation}

Students serve on various committees, which aid in making educational
policy at the college. Most committees (Academic Policies, Assessment,
Athletics, Campus Technology, Diversity, Enrollment, Financial Aid and
Academic Progress, Executive, Finance and Facilities, First-Year
Program, Internationalization, Marquis Series, Petitions, Sustainability
Council, Wellness, and Writing) include students appointed by the
Student Senate as voting members.

\section{Student Services}\label{student-services}

\subsection{Residence Life}\label{residence-life}

Coe is a residential college, in that the residence experience is an
integral part of the educational process. Students are expected to live
on campus for four years and take meals in the College hall (see
On-Campus and Off-Campus Resident Students, Section 27.1.4). The
residence halls and apartments vary in style, size, and personality. All
of the residential facilities have generous visitation policies, and
campus life functions around the concept of the living units.

Residence hall and apartment regulations are published in the
\emph{Student Reference Book}. As room charges do not include Winter
Break or Spring Break, when residential facilities and the dining hall
are closed, an additional fee is assessed to students staying on campus
during those times. Information regarding housing is sent to students
who have accepted admission to the College.

\subsection{Student Health Service}\label{student-health-service}

Coe's Student Health Service offers students medical care provided by a
part-time Advanced Registered Nurse Practitioner (ARNP) and a full-time
nurse. The Health Services staff can diagnose, manage, and treat certain
medical diagnoses, free to full-time Coe students. Referrals are
available to a family physician or specialist in the Cedar Rapids
community as needed. In the event that a student needs hospitalization,
St.~Luke's Hospital or Mercy Medical Center is utilized. The student is
responsible for all health costs beyond those provided by Health
Services. These include hospitalizations, emergency room visits,
physician visits, and prescription medications. Therefore, all students
are expected to carry medical insurance. Provisions for special diets or
other arrangements which deviate from Coe's policies require a
recommendation from the student's healthcare provider and are available
through SODEXO food services. All students are required to have a
current immunization record on file prior to registration for classes at
Coe. Students without immunizations on file will have their registration
held. Students who wish to utilize the Student Health Service should
have a physical on file, which is required of all students in order to
play collegiate sports.

\subsection{Personal Counseling}\label{personal-counseling}

Realizing that students have concerns in areas other than academic
matters and career options, Coe provides appropriate individual and
group counseling. St.~Luke's Family Counseling Center, located next to
the Coe campus, and the College work together to provide for students'
counseling needs. St.~Luke's Family Counseling Center provides
assessment, short-term counseling, and, when appropriate, referral to
community resources. Individual counseling is available from a number of
counselors on an appointment basis for students with personal, social,
and family concerns. In addition, students may seek counseling from a
pastoral and spiritual perspective from the College Chaplain. If
long-term counseling is needed, Coe's counselor and Chaplain work with
students to identify cost-effective solutions on and off campus.

\subsection{Religious Life}\label{religious-life}

Coe College believes that it is important to foster an environment that
accepts and respects the religious faith and beliefs of all its
students, staff, and faculty. The Coe community is diverse in its
religious makeup, and all members of the community are encouraged to
express and practice their particular religious traditions. To this end,
the College Chaplain seeks to provide and create an atmosphere that is
consistent with the religious heritage of the College and conducive to
the development of spiritual and moral values.

Opportunities for worship, interfaith dialogue, Bible study, retreat,
small groups, theological study, outreach, mission, meditation, and
fellowship are abundant. There are also several active religious student
organizations on campus and a specialized leadership program for
students considering vocational ministry. The Chaplain is available for
pastoral care, guided prayer, theological dialogue, pre-marital
counseling, and other spiritual needs.

\subsection{Diversity, Equity \&
Inclusion}\label{diversity-equity-inclusion}

The Office of Diversity, Equity \& Inclusion is comprised of the Dean of
Students, Coordinator of Multicultural Affairs, Director of
International Affairs, and the College Chaplain. This team works closely
with LBGTQAI+ students, multicultural students, international students,
and student allies, with the goal of fostering an environment where all
Kohawks will thrive in an inclusive learning environment. Students
interested in getting involved with Coe's diversity and inclusion
efforts are encouraged to stop by the Student Life Office in Upper Gage
and speak with a team member.

\subsection{Campus Activities}\label{campus-activities}

There is much to do on the Coe campus and in the Cedar Rapids community.
Programming of campus activities is designed to meet the educational and
recreational needs of the Coe community in a creative way. The diversity
of the student body is considered in the scheduling of recitals, plays,
exhibits, lectures, films, and concerts, as well as all school events
and relaxing evenings in Charlie's. The Director of Campus Life
coordinates the events organized by the Student Activities Committee
(SAC).

\subsection{Student Activity Groups}\label{student-activity-groups}

Students earn credit for their participation in Coe's music ensembles
(the Jazz and Concert Bands, the Symphony Orchestra, the Concert Choir,
Chorale, and the Choral Chamber Ensemble), several of which have
completed study/concert tours of Europe, Great Britain, and Asia in the
past. Coe drama and forensics activities have received local and
national recognition for their presentations. Special interest
organizations are also represented on campus, as are national social
fraternities and sororities and honor societies (Phi Beta Kappa, Phi
Kappa Phi, Mortar Board, Alpha Lambda Delta, and Alpha Sigma Lambda).

\subsection{Athletics}\label{athletics}

Coe College sponsors 11 men's and 11 women's athletic teams that compete
in the American Rivers Conference of NCAA Division III. Our goal is to
provide our student athletes with positive educational and athletic
experiences.

Through hard work, intense training, and positive interactions with
coaches, student athletes are provided opportunities to succeed. The
College recognizes that many of its students enjoy participating in
organized athletics or watching athletic contests as forms of
recreational campus life. Basketball, volleyball, softball, table
tennis, flag football, and wrestling are representative events in a
year-round intramural program for both men and women. All students are
eligible to participate.

\subsection{Recreational Facilities}\label{recreational-facilities}

Gage Memorial Union is the center of student interest and activity.
Offices of the Student Activities Committee and other student
organizations are there, plus the College dining hall, and mailroom.
Informal programs and lectures are given there, and it serves as the
College's ``open house'' for students, faculty, and visitors.
``Charlie's,'' located in the adjacent P.U.B., is home to a coffee shop
(serving Starbucks coffee), a convenience store, and grill. Charlie's is
a relaxing place to meet friends or take in one of the many
performances.

The brand-new Coe College Athletics and Recreation Center includes two
pristine courts for basketball and volleyball, a wrestling room that
boasts three oversized mats, strength and conditioning room with
brand-new equipment, and a fitness center that overlooks the campus.
This is where Coe's basketball, volleyball, and wrestling teams host
their home events.

Moray Eby Fieldhouse includes three recently-renovated courts for
basketball and volleyball. Eby also has a natatorium, athletic training
rooms, indoor baseball/softball batting cages, and a rock-climbing wall.
All outside playing fields and tennis courts are also available to Coe
students.

The Clark Racquet Center offers a state-of-the-art facility for runners,
racquet enthusiasts, and everyone wanting to stay in shape. An aerobic
room, dance studio, and classrooms complement the indoor track, tennis
courts, and racquetball and squash courts. Professional staff manage the
center and offer instruction to students.

\part{COLLEGE REGULATIONS}

\chapter{EFFECTIVE CATALOG}\label{effective-catalog}

Students ordinarily are graduated under the provisions of the catalog of
their matriculation date. A student's matriculation date is the day of
first enrollment following admission. If the student is readmitted, the
matriculation date becomes the day of first enrollment following
readmission. However, students will be expected to satisfy, to the
extent practical, the graduation requirements of the catalog in effect
at the anticipated date of graduation. Any necessary modification of
general degree requirements will be worked out by the Provost and Dean
of the Faculty, the Registrar, the appropriate department chair, and the
Academic Policies Committee. Modification of major or minor requirements
will be worked out by the department chair involved, the Registrar, and
the student's advisor. A student has the right of petition to the
Committee on Petitions.

\subsection{Status Marks}\label{status-marks}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{W} Approved withdrawal from a course.
\item
  \textbf{X} Course extends beyond term. An ``X'' status grade is given
  in courses designated in the Catalog as having coursework that extends
  beyond the end of the term. Under no circumstances can an ``X'' grade
  remain unresolved for more than one calendar year.
\item
  \textbf{O} No mark had been reported by the instructor by the time
  academic reports were processed.
\item
  \textbf{I} Incomplete. An ``I'' status grade is reported only for
  students who are unable to complete the work in the course due to
  extenuating circumstances. The normal length of time for resolution of
  an incomplete is within four weeks of the next Fall or Spring term in
  which the student enrolls. If the instructor believes the resolution
  of the incomplete will take longer, the instructor will note the later
  deadline when reporting the incomplete status grade. An unresolved
  incomplete will automatically become a failing grade after the
  deadline, unless the instructor notes otherwise when reporting the
  incomplete. Under no circumstances can an ``I'' grade remain
  unresolved for more than one calendar year.
\item
  \textbf{R} The prefix ``R'' to a grade (i.e., RA, RB, RC, RD, RF)
  indicates a grade of repeated course. A student may repeat a course
  previously taken, and registration must indicate this repeat. Failure
  to register for a repeat course properly results in no recognition of
  the second attempt. Only the grade earned when the course is retaken
  is used in computing the GPA. Credit may be earned only once for a
  given course. Courses may be repeated only once, although, students
  may petition for a second repeat if extenuating circumstances exist.
\item
  \textbf{EQ} Equivalent credit recognized; no credit given. Does not
  increase courses attempted. For a student who has completed four
  course credits of student teaching and who has high school or life
  experience equivalent to a regular catalog course, the said course,
  upon recommendation of the Education chair and the chair of the
  department in which equivalent credit is being recognized, may be
  listed on the student's transcript with the appropriate credit and a
  status mark of ``EQ.''
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Audited Courses}\label{audited-courses}

Students may audit courses with the consent of the instructor. In doing
so, they attend class but are not required to take tests or submit
papers. Audited courses receive no credit and do not appear on
transcripts. Auditors pay a reduced tuition charge.

\subsection{First Course Grading For Non-Traditional
Students}\label{first-course-grading-for-non-traditional-students}

Individuals who have been away from the collegiate routine for several
years may register on an audit basis in their first course, participate
fully in the class (including tests, papers, etc.), and decide at the
conclusion of the course if they wish to pay the other half of the
tuition and receive credit for the course. This policy applies only to
the first course---not to succeeding courses.

\subsection{Pass / Not-Pass Graded
Courses}\label{pass-not-pass-graded-courses}

Courses are graded A--F unless otherwise indicated in the course
description that only P/NP is an option (e.g., student teaching,
internships). Courses graded P/NP count as credits towards graduation
but do not affect the student's GPA. In addition, students may opt to
take up to four A--F graded courses on a P/NP basis. When students opt
for P/NP grading, the Office of the Registrar converts any grade a
faculty member provides of D- or better to a P, and any grade of F to an
NP. In order to count for Writing Emphasis credit, a submitted grade of
C or higher must be earned.

The following regulations apply:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Students are permitted to change the method of grading for a course
  from a letter grade to P/NP. This change is allowed from the start of
  the term of enrollment through the last day to withdraw from courses
  during that term. See Academic Calendar Section 3.0.1 for official
  dates.
\item
  Students may elect to take up to four graded courses during their
  undergraduate career on a P/NP basis. However:

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\alph{enumii}.}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Students cannot use a course for which they elected P/NP grading to
    satisfy the requirements for a major or minor.
  \item
    Students cannot elect P/NP grading while on academic probation,
    though provisionally-admitted First Year students are allowed the
    option of P/NP grading.
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  The Registrar will not inform the instructor of the student's request
  for P/NP grading and the instructor must provide the Registrar with an
  appropriate letter grade.
\item
  A student's request for P/NP grading may be nullified at any time
  before the end of the third business day after grades are due in the
  student's final term. A written notice must be sent to the Office of
  the Registrar to communicate the student's intent to replace the P or
  NP grade with the instructor's letter grade.
\item
  A student's request to change their method of grading to P/NP in lieu
  of a letter grade counts as one of the four P/NP elected courses
  during the student's undergraduate career, regardless of whether it is
  later nullified.
\item
  Ordinarily a student is limited to one course credit per term on an
  elected P/NP basis. A student wishing to exceed this limitation must
  present a convincing rationale or significant mitigating circumstances
  to the Committee on Petitions.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Midterm Grades}\label{midterm-grades}

Midterm grades are not official evaluations and are not part of the
official transcript. The goal of midterm grades is to help students take
responsibility for their academic progress. Faculty submit midterm
grades of A-F for students in all full-term courses. Midterm grades are
not intended to be a guarantee, promise, or contract regarding the final
grade a student will earn in the class. Instead they provide information
for students about their academic performance.

\chapter{CLASS DESIGNATION}\label{class-designation}

Class Designation is determined by the number of course credits earned
following the Fall and Spring Terms.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  First-year student: Fewer than 8.0 course credits earned\\
\item
  Sophomore: 8.0--15.9 course credits earned
\item
  Junior: 16.0--23.9 course credits earned
\item
  Senior: 24.0 or more course credits earned
\end{itemize}

\chapter{REGISTRATION}\label{registration}

Before being allowed to register, students must have been admitted for
study by the Office of Admission, must have settled their account with
the Business Office, and must meet with their Academic Advisor.
Registrations are canceled for failure to pay fees on time.

Students are encouraged to develop a four-year comprehensive educational
plan with the help of their advisor or with other members of the
faculty.

Students who will not graduate during the current academic year register
online during the Spring Term for the Fall Term of the following
academic year during times specified by the Office of the Registrar.
Registration for the Spring and May Terms takes place during the
preceding Fall Term. Once the online registration period is over, all
changes to registration must take place in the Office of the Registrar
using accurate, legible, and completed registration forms. Entering
first-year students and transfer students receive instructions with
their orientation materials, and readmitted students receive
instructions from the Office of the Registrar concerning their
registrations. Registrations are not accepted for a term without
successful petition after the end of the first week of classes of that
term.

\subsection{Changes in Registration}\label{changes-in-registration}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Unless a course is registered by a student online during the
  registration period, they must intentionally file a registration form
  with the Office of the Registrar in order to be registered for a
  course. Registration forms for course additions must be approved by
  the student's advisor and instructor of the course.
\item
  Courses may be added or dropped during the first five weeks of the
  Fall, Spring, or Summer Term, including 7-week courses. Students may
  add a May Term course during the first three days of the term. If a
  student needs to add a course after these deadlines due to extenuating
  circumstances, the student must petition the Committee on Petitions by
  completing the appropriate forms.
\end{enumerate}

For courses spanning a fraction of a Term, the last date to add or drop
without a ``W'' will be calculated as a proportionate time frame
comparatively as full-term courses. See Academic Calendar (see p.~12)
for official dates for full-term and half-term courses. 3. A student may
withdraw from one or more courses with the following results: - If a
student withdraws from a course when 2/3 or less of the Term is
completed, a ``W'' (withdrawal) grade will be entered on the student's
permanent record. This grade will not affect the student's GPA. This is
the date listed in the academic calendar as the Last Day to Withdraw
from a course.\\
- For courses spanning a fraction of a Term, the last date to withdraw
with a ``W'' will be calculated using the 2/3 fraction. See Academic
Calendar (p.~15) for official dates for full-term and half-term courses.
- If a student officially withdraws from a course after 2/3 of the Term
is completed, a ``WF'' will be entered on the student's permanent
record. This will affect the student's GPA (see p.~53). - A withdrawn
course, regardless of the date withdrawn, counts as attempted credits on
the transcript. Therefore, it also counts when calculating academic
standing (see p.~61), and satisfactory academic progress (see p.~275)
for financial aid.

\subsection{Course Load}\label{course-load}

A student is full-time for the Fall or Spring Term when enrolled for
three or more course credits. A student enrolled for less than this
course load is a part-time student. For financial aid purposes,
half-time is defined as enrollment in no fewer than two course credits
in each of the Fall and Spring Terms; three-fourths is defined as
enrollment in no fewer than 2.5 course credits in each of the Fall and
Spring Terms. Students who have earned a cumulative GPA of 3.4 or above,
or have earned both 23 credits and a cumulative GPA of 2.5 or above, may
take above 4.99 credits without the need for a petition, but approval
must be secured from the Office of the Registrar. Other students must
submit a petition to the Committee on Petitions and obtain approval in
order to register for five or more course credits. No student shall be
permitted to register for over 5.99 credits in each of the Fall and
Spring Terms. Only petitions from those students who have completed at
least one term as a full-time student will be considered by the
Committee on Petitions. Students may not register for more than one
course credit during May Term.

\chapter{ACADEMIC INTEGRITY POLICY}\label{academic-integrity-policy}

At Coe College, we expect academic integrity of all members of our
community. Academic integrity assumes honesty about the nature of one's
work in all situations. Such honesty is at the heart of the educational
enterprise and is a precondition for intellectual growth. Academic
dishonesty is the willful attempt to misrepresent one's work, cheat,
plagiarize, or impede other students' academic progress. Academic
dishonesty interferes with the mission of the College and will be
treated with the utmost seriousness as a violation of community
standards.

\subsection{Forms of Academic
Dishonesty}\label{forms-of-academic-dishonesty}

\textbf{Cheating} is the attempt to deceive an evaluator by claiming
credit for work one has not done or by knowingly assisting such an
attempt. It includes (but is not limited to) the use of unauthorized
sources of information on in-class or take-home exams, or other
assignments; copying from other students on exams, assignments, or lab
reports; fabrication of data, research, quotations, or other
information; and taking credit for collaborations to which one has not
contributed.

\textbf{Plagiarism} is the use of someone else's words or ideas without
acknowledgement and, when intentional, is a form of academic dishonesty.
The unacknowledged use of words or ideas from any published or
unpublished sources, including Internet resources or other student
papers, constitutes plagiarism. Plagiarism may occur intentionally or
unintentionally through the omission of appropriate citations. Any ideas
or information the student adopts from a source, whether or not directly
quoted, must be acknowledged by specific reference in notes or the text.

\textbf{Any words or phrases} that are taken from a source must be
quoted and cited. Any paraphrase---the restatement of an idea in your
own words---must be cited.

The methods of citation and documentation vary from discipline to
discipline. Students are responsible for determining the appropriate
method for any given assignment or, in the absence of a clearly stated
protocol, using any accepted academic method. Guidelines can be found on
the library website and in the Writing Center.

\textbf{Other forms of academic dishonesty} include (but are not limited
to) deliberately impeding other students' work and misuse of common
academic property, in the libraries, labs, and elsewhere.

\subsection{Sanctions}\label{sanctions}

Instructors have responsibility for determining whether academic
dishonesty has occurred. Instructors shall proceed with sanctions
accordingly. Any act of academic dishonesty that results in one of the
sanctions below shall be detailed in a formal report filed with the
Provost and Dean of the Faculty.

Cases of unintentional plagiarism may be dealt with through educational
procedures such as further assignments requiring the student to practice
documentation and citation methods, or other means determined by the
instructor.

Acts of academic dishonesty will be subject to one or more of the
following sanctions:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  failure of the assignment, i.e.~exam, paper, lab report, etc.
\item
  failure of the class
\item
  suspension or expulsion
\end{enumerate}

An instructor may impose the first two of these penalties. Suspension or
expulsion may only be carried out by the Provost and Dean of the
Faculty.

Repeated acts of academic dishonesty will result in suspension or
expulsion. When academic dishonesty has been determined to have occurred
a second time, the Provost and Dean of the Faculty shall decide on the
student's status at the College.

\subsection{Procedure}\label{procedure}

When an instance of academic dishonesty is suspected, the instructor
will meet with the student to discuss the incident and will decide
which, if any, of the above sanctions is appropriate.

If warranted, the instructor will send a report to the Provost, with a
copy given to the student, which details the nature of the violation and
the steps taken to address it. The Provost will send a letter to the
student within ten business days of receipt of the faculty member's
report. The letter will reiterate the incident, describe the sanctions,
and inform the student of their right to appeal. The report and letter
from the Provost will remain on file in the Academic Affairs Office
until five years after the student's graduation or severance from Coe.
The Vice President for Student Life will be notified that a report has
been filed. Information in the file will be confidential, to be shared
only at the discretion of the Provost and Dean of the Faculty for a
legitimate educational or legal purpose.

\subsection{Appeals Process}\label{appeals-process}

The student may appeal the charge and/or the sanction within ten
business days of receiving the Provost's letter of notice by emailing
the Provost and Dean of the Faculty requesting an appeals hearing.
Students wishing to appeal are strongly encouraged to consult with the
Director of Academic Achievement, who has been designated by the College
to provide information and advocacy in these matters.

The Provost's Office will convene an Academic Integrity Appeals Board
within ten business days of receipt of the request for appeal to hear
the appeal. The Academic Integrity Appeals Board will be chaired by
either the chair or co-chair of the Academic Policies Committee.
Additional members of the board will include: one additional faculty
member on the Academic Policies Committee, the senior Student Life
officer, one faculty member from the Committee on Admission, Retention,
and Enrollment, and the Associate Dean for Student Academics. ~In any
hearing the Provost may replace the Associate Dean for Student Success,
or other member of the board to avoid conflicts of interest. The student
may choose to have a faculty or staff member present as an observer. The
student and the instructor will each appear as witnesses and each may
request that other pertinent witnesses appear.

A majority vote of the Appeals Board is necessary to uphold or overturn
a sanction. If a sanction is overturned, the Appeals Board may impose a
lesser sanction. The Appeals Board will submit a written finding which
will be sent to the student and the faculty member(s) involved in the
case and which will become part of the student's file. If the appeal's
outcome is to overturn the dishonesty charge, the report in the Academic
Affairs Integrity file will be removed.

\chapter{ACADEMIC STANDING}\label{academic-standing}

All students are expected to meet the College's standards for academic
performance (see chart below). These are in place to keep students on
track towards meeting the graduation requirements of the college (32
credits with a cumulative GPA of 2.0). Students who do not meet Coe's
academic standards may be put on probation or suspended from the
College.

To make sure that students are aware when their academic standing is in
jeopardy, a series of communications are issued throughout an academic
term including D/F notices, academic warnings, and notices of academic
probation. Unless otherwise stated, these communications will be sent to
the student by email and by a letter to the student's Coe mailbox.
Additionally, an email will be sent to the student's advisor.

\subsection{D/F Notices}\label{df-notices}

Academic notices are issued at midterm to students who earn a D, F, or
NP in one or more courses. Students receiving these notices are expected
to meet with their academic advisor to identify appropriate support.

\subsection{Academic Warnings}\label{academic-warnings}

Academic warnings will be issued to students who earn a term grade point
average below 2.00. Students receiving academic warnings are strongly
encouraged to re-evaluate their current approach to their studies and/or
their academic plans. They are expected to meet with their academic
advisor and/or a Learning Commons staff member.

\section{Academic Probation}\label{academic-probation}

The Academic Standing Committee reviews academic records of all students
at the conclusion of both the Fall and Spring Terms. A student is placed
on academic probation if the cumulative GPA falls below the minimum GPA
levels listed below:

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}ll@{}}
\toprule\noalign{}
\textbf{Total Course Credits Attempted} & \textbf{Minimum GPA Levels} \\
\midrule\noalign{}
\endhead
\bottomrule\noalign{}
\endlastfoot
0.0 -- 4.99 & l.50 \\
5.0 -- 7.9 & l.75 \\
8.0 -- 11.9 & 1.80 \\
12.0 -- 15.9 & 1.90 \\
16.0+ & 2.00 \\
\end{longtable}

To return to good standing and be removed from academic probation, a
student shall earn a cumulative GPA greater than the threshold for
academic probation as specified above. If the student's cumulative GPA
decreases at the end of any term on probation, the student is subject to
academic suspension. Students who are placed on academic probation have
a maximum of two (2) consecutive terms, excluding May and Summer, to
return to good standing before they are subject to academic suspension.

Students who are on academic probation: - Are expected to comply with
any requirements outlined by the Academic Standing Committee. - May not
elect P/NP grading in lieu of a letter grade. - May not be excused from
attending class to participate in extra-curricular activities.

The status of academic probation is noted on a student's transcript.

Students on probation who are not meeting the conditions of their
probation and not performing at a passing level in their courses may be
withdrawn from the College during the term on the recommendation of the
Academic Standing Committee. If the student had previously appealed a
suspension, the suspension is reinstated. Otherwise, the student will
exit the College with a leave of absence and is eligible to return on
probation the following term. Students may appeal this decision to the
Provost.

\section{Academic Suspension}\label{academic-suspension}

Students who do not meet the conditions of their academic probation or
who fall below retention thresholds (see below) will be considered for
academic suspension by the Academic Standing Committee, and, if
suspended, will be unable to take courses at Coe College for a period of
at least one academic year. (One academic year is defined as a Fall and
Spring Term, and does not count May or Summer Terms.) A registration
hold preventing registration will be placed on the student's account. A
student already registered for the following term will be dropped from
those courses.

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}ll@{}}
\toprule\noalign{}
\textbf{Total Course Credits Attempted} & \textbf{Minimum GPA Levels} \\
\midrule\noalign{}
\endhead
\bottomrule\noalign{}
\endlastfoot
0.0 -- 4.99 & 0.50 \\
5.0 -- 7.9 & l.00 \\
8.0 -- 11.9 & 1.50 \\
12.0 -- 15.9 & 1.70 \\
16.0 -- 19.9 & 1.80 \\
20.0 -- 23.9 & 1.90 \\
24 + & 2.00 \\
\end{longtable}

Students who are placed on suspension for academic reasons will receive
a letter notifying them of their suspension at their home residence, by
registered mail, as well as a letter in their Coe mailbox and an email
to their Coe email. Suspended students have the right to appeal for
immediate readmission if they can provide evidence of circumstances that
would warrant reconsideration by the deadline indicated in their
suspension letter.

To appeal for immediate readmission:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  A suspended student appealing for readmission must submit an appeals
  letter by mail, email, or delivery in person to the Office of the
  Provost. The letter must include an explanation of any circumstances
  that affected the student's academic performance. The letter should
  provide a detailed plan with specific actions that the student will
  take to improve their academic standing, and explain how the student
  will overcome the obstacles that affected their academic performance.
  Student appeals will not be considered if a written statement is not
  received by the deadline.
\item
  Although not mandatory, the suspended student appealing for
  readmission is urged to schedule to meet with the Academic Standing
  Committee on the date designated in the suspension letter. At this
  meeting the student will have the opportunity to respond to questions
  the Committee may have on the circumstances outlined in the student's
  letter requesting readmission.
\item
  A suspended student appealing for readmission is encouraged to request
  a letter of support for immediate readmission from a faculty advisor
  or other faculty or staff member at Coe, if the letter can shed light
  on the student's ability and motivation to do well in future academic
  endeavors. Similarly, the student is encouraged to consult with one or
  more faculty or staff members to prepare a strong case for
  readmission.
\end{itemize}

Students who have been suspended for academic reasons from the College
once, can return to the College either through a successful appeal for
immediate readmission or through readmission after leaving for at least
one academic year. A student who is suspended for academic reasons more
than once cannot appeal for immediate readmission and must leave the
College for at least one academic year.

\section{Interim Suspension}\label{interim-suspension}

Interim Suspension is a situation where it is determined that a
student's continued presence at the college constitutes an immediate
threat of harm to the student, other individuals, or to the stability
and continuance of normal College functions. The Provost and Dean of
Students or their designee may suspend a student pending disciplinary
proceedings. Such suspension may become effective immediately and
without prior notice.

Interim suspension shall be considered an excused absence until the
conclusion of formal hearings. The student will be offered the
opportunity to make up any academic work missed during the time in which
the interim suspension was imposed. It is the student's responsibility
to make specific arrangements with faculty members to complete academic
work. The Dean of Students will initiate communication with the
appropriate faculty.

\section{Readmission Following
Suspension}\label{readmission-following-suspension}

Coe College's academic suspension policy allows students, who are not
readmitted immediately through appeal, to apply for readmission after at
least one academic year has passed.

To be considered for readmission, the student must submit a letter of
appeal to the Office of the Provost. In the appeals letter, the student
must present evidence that demonstrates how the circumstances that led
to the student's academic suspension have been addressed, and how the
student plans to be successful in his or her academic future.
Readmission is determined by the Academic Standing Committee. The
Academic Standing Committee reserves the right to conduct its own
investigation, review the case, and make a final decision concerning the
student's reinstatement to the College. When appropriate, certain
academic stipulations may be applied. If a suspended student provides
evidence of successful course completion elsewhere and/or written
evidence of motivation and maturity necessary to be academically
successful at Coe, the student may be readmitted on probation at Coe.

\section{Exiting the College}\label{exiting-the-college}

The exit process at Coe College, whether through withdrawing or taking a
leave of absence, is initiated by the student. The exit procedure is
initiated in the Learning Commons (Stewart Memorial Library) and begins
with an interview with the Associate Dean of Student Academics or the
Director of the TRIO-Academic Achievement Program. At the interview, the
student is given an official exit form on which to secure signatures
from the following: the Student Financial Services Office, to verify a
balance due or a credit to be refunded, as well as Student Loan
information, to be aware of financial aid adjustments; the Library, to
ascertain that all materials have been returned; and the Resident
Director of the student's residence hall, to arrange for room checkout.
The completed exit form is returned to the Learning Commons which will
then notify other pertinent areas of the student's withdrawal.

If a student is unable to complete the official withdrawal process, the
intent to withdraw or take a leave of absence can be communicated to one
of the following offices: Registrar, Student Financial Services, Student
Life.

If a student withdraws from all courses during a period of enrollment
for which he or she received financial aid, the Student Financial
Services Office will determine how much, if any, of the student's
financial aid proceeds must be returned to the College, based on a
federally mandated refund formula (see Return of Title IV
Funds/Institutional Refund Policy, p.~268).

Special consideration is given to students who withdrew due to a call to
active duty. Coe's ``Military Call Up/Refund''~and ``Readmission of
Service Member''~policies are published on the Admission/Financial Aid
webpage. Copies of these policies can be requested from the Student
Financial Services Office.

\section{Leave of Absence}\label{leave-of-absence}

A student may find it necessary to interrupt a program of study at the
College. Under this condition, the student may apply for a leave of
absence. A leave of absence may be granted for a period not to exceed 12
months. Students may extend a leave of absence for up to a total of 36
months by contacting the Office of the Registrar via email at
o-registrar@coe.edu. Students that do not renew their Leave of Absence,
or return to Coe, will be officially withdrawn from the College.
Coursework completed while on leave from the College is subject to the
same conditions as work in transfer.

\section{Requesting a leave of
Absence}\label{requesting-a-leave-of-absence}

Students planning to leave of absence from the College should consult
their academic advisor and then they \emph{must declare} their intent to
one of the following designated offices: Student Financial Services,
Registrar, Residence Life, or the Learning Commons. Please refer to the
previous section on exiting the College for the steps that follow.~

\section{On Leave of Absence}\label{on-leave-of-absence}

The Coe community is committed to supporting students while they are
away from the College. Thus, the Associate Dean of Student Academics may
assign a designee who will be the point of contact to each student on a
Leave of Absence. This designee will stay in contact with the student
during their time away from the College, as appropriate, and will assist
with the return process once the student is ready to resume coursework.~

\section{Returning to Coe after a Leave of
Absence}\label{returning-to-coe-after-a-leave-of-absence}

Students planning on returning to the College do not need to apply for
readmission, but must submit a statement of intent to re-enroll to the
Office of the Registrar and the Associate Dean of Student Academics, or
designee, who will assist with the return process. Students are strongly
encouraged to schedule a consultation with the Associate Dean of Student
Academics, or designee, by December 1st for returning the Spring Term,
or August 1st to return the Fall Term. If a student wants to register
during the regular registration time (November for Spring Term or late
March / early April for Fall Term), they will need to submit their
statement of intent and contact the Associate Dean of Student Academics,
or designee, at least two weeks before Registration. The exact date
of~Registration can be found on the Academic Calendar on the Coe website
under the Academics tab.~

\section{Withdrawal from the College and
Readmission}\label{withdrawal-from-the-college-and-readmission}

Admission for work toward a degree terminates and the student is
considered withdrawn from the College if:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  A full-time student does not enroll at Coe for the next term
  (excluding May Term) and has not completed a Leave of Absence form.
  This does not apply to students in College-approved off-campus study
  programs.
\item
  A part-time student does not enroll for a course at Coe in a 12-month
  period and has not completed a Leave of Absence form.
\end{enumerate}

Students wishing to resume work toward a degree, once admission status
has terminated, must apply for readmission.

Students previously enrolled at Coe and readmitted after an absence of
two years or more may request that all previous work at Coe be
re-evaluated by the Registrar on the same basis as credits offered in
transfer. Re-evaluation means that only courses with grades of C or
better will be counted for credit toward graduation. All courses
affected by the re-evaluation and the grade earned for each course will
remain on the student's permanent record but will not factor into the
cumulative GPA or be counted toward graduation.

\chapter{TRANSCRIPT EVALUATION
POLICIES}\label{transcript-evaluation-policies}

Official transcripts for courses taken at Coe College can only be issued
by the Office of the Registrar and only after the office has received a
written request and payment from the student.

\section{General Policy On Transfer
Credit}\label{general-policy-on-transfer-credit}

To honor its mission and to preserve its academic integrity as a liberal
arts institution, the College accepts a course in transfer for the
equivalent earned credit (4 semester hours = 1 course credit), if that
course meets the spirit of the College's mission and is from a
regionally accredited institution. In cases where it is unclear whether
the course would be acceptable for transfer credit, the Registrar and
the appropriate department chair will consult. Other exceptions are
referred to the Committee on Petitions.

\section{Evaluation Of Credits In
Transfer}\label{evaluation-of-credits-in-transfer}

The Office of the Registrar is responsible for the evaluation of
transfer credit. Credits accepted in transfer do not affect the
cumulative GPA. Grades for the credits accepted are not recorded on
Coe's transcript. Thus, transfer credits increase only the total courses
attempted and the total course credits earned. Credit is not accepted
for coursework earning a grade below ``C'' (2.0 on a 4.0 scale).

\section{Junior or Community College
Credit}\label{junior-or-community-college-credit}

No more than 50\% of the course credits required for a degree at Coe
will be accepted in transfer from 2-year colleges. A maximum of 16
credits will be accepted as transfer credit from 2-year regionally
accredited institutions. Transfer students who complete a regionally
accredited A.A. degree program or a regionally accredited
college-parallel A.S. degree program will be accorded junior status (16
course credits) at Coe. Transfer students who complete an A.A., A.S., or
A.A.S. degree from a regionally accredited institution with which Coe
has a specific articulation agreement will be awarded credit consistent
with that agreement.

\section{European Credit Transfer System
(ECTS)}\label{european-credit-transfer-system-ects}

ECTS credits are a relative rather than an absolute measure of student
workload.~ They specify how much of a year's workload a course unit
represents at the institution or department allocating the credits.~ECTS
is thus based on a full student workload and not limited to contact
hours only. In ECTS, 60 credits represent the workload of a normal
undergraduate academic year of study and normally 30 credits for a
semester and 20 credits for a term. Thus, ECTS credits will~normally~be
transferred to Coe College at a rate of 7.5 ECTS credits: 1 Coe credit.

\section{Occasional Transfer Credit For Degree-Seeking
Students}\label{occasional-transfer-credit-for-degree-seeking-students}

Degree-seeking students sometimes wish to transfer credit from another
institution toward their degree at Coe. Such credit must be approved in
advance of completion of the course by the Registrar. Departments must
approve in advance any courses counting toward a major, a minor, or
teacher certification requirements. Credit from junior or community
colleges is not accepted for students who have junior or higher status
at Coe.

\section{Evaluation of Credits For
Graduation}\label{evaluation-of-credits-for-graduation}

The Office of the Registrar certifies the completion of general degree
(see p.~16) and general education requirements (see p.~23). Credits
toward a major, minor, endorsement, license, authorization, etc. are
approved by the appropriate department chair, administrative
coordinator, or by Academic Policies Committee for interdisciplinary
majors.

\section{Credit By Examination}\label{credit-by-examination}

A maximum of eight course credits in satisfaction of degree requirements
may be applied from credit earned through the Advanced Placement Program
and International Baccalaureate.

\section{Updating Coursework}\label{updating-coursework}

In the natural course of reviewing academic records, a student may be
required to repeat certain courses (or appropriate substitutes) taken
more than four years prior to the review to bring studies in those areas
up to date. Review cases may be brought to the Academic Policies
Committee by any member of the faculty, and this committee makes the
final decision.

\section{Advanced Placement (AP)}\label{advanced-placement-ap}

Coe College's Advanced Placement code is 6101.

Coe College grants college credit for approved Advanced Placement
examination scores of 4 or 5. AP credit cannot be used to fulfill any
general education requirement, including First-Year Seminar, Liberal
Arts Core, Diverse Cultural Perspectives, the writing emphasis
requirement, credit in transfer to reduce the number writing emphasis
courses required, or academic practicum. Each AP exam may earn 1.0
course credit up to a maximum of eight course credits towards
graduation. Credit is granted upon receipt of the results of the
examination, which must be received directly from the Educational
Testing Service. Further information regarding Advanced Placement
examination reporting to the College may be obtained in the Office of
the Registrar and on Coe's website. If an equivalent course is taken at
Coe College, the AP credit is removed from the transcript.

\section{International Baccalaureate
(IB)}\label{international-baccalaureate-ib}

Coe College credit may be awarded for International Baccalaureate work.
Students may earn 1.0 course credit for each higher-level examination
score of 5, 6, or 7 to a maximum of eight course credits. No credit is
granted for standard level examinations. Students may not receive
college credit for both AP and IB in areas of similar content. IB credit
cannot be used to fulfill any general education requirement, including
First-Year Seminar, Liberal Arts Core, Diverse Cultural Perspectives,
the writing emphasis requirement, credit in transfer to reduce the
number of writing emphasis courses required, or academic practicum.
Credit is granted upon receipt of the results of the examination, which
must be received directly from IB. Further information regarding
International Baccalaureate examination reporting to the College may be
obtained in the Office of the Registrar and on Coe's website. If an
equivalent course is taken at Coe College, the IB credit is removed from
the transcript.

\section{Class Attendance}\label{class-attendance}

Regular class attendance is expected, although the instructor of each
course sets the standard expected to be met by the students. The College
expects attendance on all scheduled days, including the first and last
day of a term, as well as the class days immediately preceding and
following College holidays. Students officially representing the College
are excused as necessary prior to the absence. Students on academic
probation are not excused from attending class to participate in
extra-curricular activities.

\section{Final Exams}\label{final-exams}

The final exam schedule is published by the Registrar. It is expected
that final exams will be given during the time scheduled for each
course. There may be extraordinary cases when an individual student has
a compelling reason for taking an exam at a time other than that
scheduled. In such cases the instructor may properly decide to let that
individual take the exam at another time. Having more than two exams
scheduled on one day would justify allowing a student to take a third
exam on another day. The instructor of the course with the highest
course number will move the exam, for that student only, to a mutually
convenient time.

\section{Participation In
Commencement}\label{participation-in-commencement}

Students can participate in Commencement when they have met all the
requirements for graduation for one of Coe's degrees, their financial
obligations to Coe College are met, and they have completed their Intent
to Graduate form and it has been approved. In addition, all students,
unless excused in writing by the Provost, must complete a survey
assessing their educational experience at Coe. All pending graduates
must participate in Commencement exercises unless excused in writing by
the Registrar..

\section{Pending Graduates}\label{pending-graduates}

Students who need to earn no more than 2.0 course credits to complete
all graduation requirements may be permitted to participate in
Commencement exercises as long as the remaining course credits are
scheduled to be completed by August 15 of that year. Pending graduates
will be listed in the Commencement booklet, but since Latin honors (see
Section 13.2.2) are bestowed only after all graduation requirements are
met, they cannot be listed in the Commencement booklet for Latin honors,
although any earned honors will be listed on their diploma and
transcript.

\chapter{STUDENT NOTIFICATION OF RIGHTS UNDER
FERPA}\label{student-notification-of-rights-under-ferpa}

The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) affords students
certain rights with respect to their education records. They are:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  the right to inspect and review the student's education records within
  45 days of the day the College receives a request for access. Students
  should submit to the Office of the Registrar written requests that
  identify the record(s) they wish to inspect. The Registrar will make
  arrangements for access and notifies the student of the time and place
  where the records may be inspected. If the records are not maintained
  by the Office of the Registrar, the Registrar shall advise the student
  of the correct official to whom the request should be addressed.
\item
  the right to request the amendment of the student's education records
  that the student believes are inaccurate or misleading. Students may
  ask the College to amend records that they believe are inaccurate or
  misleading. They should write the College official responsible for the
  records, clearly identify the part of the record they want changed,
  and specify why it is inaccurate or misleading. FERPA was not intended
  to provide a process to be used to question substantive judgments
  which are correctly recorded. The rights of challenge are not intended
  to allow students to contest, for example, a grade in a course because
  they felt a higher grade should have been assigned. If the College
  decides not to amend the record as requested by the student, the
  College will notify the student of the decision and advise the student
  of his or her right to a hearing regarding the request for amendment.
  Additional information regarding the hearing procedures will be
  provided to the student when notified of the right to a hearing.
\item
  the right to consent to disclosures of personally identifiable
  information contained in the student's education records, except to
  the extent that FERPA authorized disclosure without consent. One
  exception which permits disclosure without consent is disclosure to
  school officials with legitimate educational interests. A school
  official is a person employed by the College in an administrative,
  supervisory, academic or research, or support staff position
  (including law enforcement unit personnel and health staff); a person
  or company with whom the College has contracted (such as an attorney,
  auditor, collection agent, or official of the National Student
  Clearinghouse); or a student serving on an official committee, such as
  an admission, petitions, retention, honors recognition, disciplinary,
  or grievance committee, or assisting another school official in
  performing his or her tasks. A school official has a legitimate
  educational interest if the official needs to review an education
  record in order to fulfill his or her professional responsibility.
\item
  the right to file a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education
  concerning alleged failures by the College to comply with the
  requirements of FERPA.
\end{itemize}

A student is a person who attends or has attended Coe College, as
determined by matriculation and enrollment by the first date of an
academic term. Coe College obtains written permission from the student
before releasing any information from a student's educational record in
most cases. However, as the law allows, on a case-by-case basis,
appropriate parts of a student record may be disclosed, without consent
of the student, to the following parties:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  college employees who have a legitimate need to know.
\item
  persons who need to know in cases of health and safety emergencies.
\item
  accrediting organizations to carry out accrediting functions.
\item
  appropriate parties in connection with financial aid to a student.
\item
  federal, state, and local governmental officials for purposes
  authorized by law.
\item
  individuals who have lawfully obtained court orders or subpoenas.
\item
  organizations conducting educational studies for the College.
\item
  courts during litigation between the College and the student or
  parent.
\item
  victim of crime of violence after final results of a disciplinary
  hearing.
\item
  public after disciplinary proceedings determine student committed
  crime of violence.
\end{itemize}

In many situations, complaints relative to FERPA can be resolved with
the College on an informal basis by contacting the Registrar, in the
lower level of Voorhees Hall.

\textbf{To file a FERPA complaint} with the U.S. Department of
Education, contact the office that administers FERPA at: Family Policy
Compliance Office, U.S. Dept. of Education, 400 Maryland Avenue SW,
Washington, DC 20202-4605.

\section{Occasional Courses}\label{occasional-courses}

Additional courses, not found in the Catalog, may be offered
occasionally and serve one or more of the following purposes:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  to provide the opportunity for research, creative, or other scholarly
  activity for an instructor jointly with interested students;
\item
  to explore and develop intellectual pursuits which are attractive to
  members of the faculty;
\item
  to respond to student requests for courses which are distinctive,
  unusual, or meet specific needs;
\item
  to bridge between two or more disciplines or curricular categories;
\item
  to serve as one means of developing and testing a possible permanent

Coe College believes that the most effective preparation for teaching is
one that combines a liberal arts education with courses in the theory
and practice of teaching. The Education Department has the
responsibility for coordinating the efforts of the College to provide
such a program.\\
Basic college requirements and those for a major area give students a
well-rounded general education. Professional courses in education
provide a foundation in principles and practices of teaching. Students
gain practical experience in applying professional and general education
through field experiences and, if pursuing licensure, through student
teaching in area schools. Students who successfully complete Coe's
Teacher Education Program and student teaching are eligible to apply for
an Iowa Initial Teacher License. Teaching licensure is governed by State
of Iowa regulations. When changes in licensure requirements occur at the
state level, they take precedence over College policies. For the most
current policy information, students should consult the \emph{Guide to
Teacher Education}, available from the Education Department. The
Education Department maintains records regarding Iowa licensure
requirements. Students should consult a faculty member in the Education
Department to arrange their respective courses of study. The Teacher
Education Program at Coe College is approved by the Iowa Department of
Education. Copies of the annual report filed with the Iowa Department of
Education are available on request.

\subsection{Elementary Education
Major}\label{elementary-education-major}

Teachers in elementary schools function as generalists who must draw
upon a broad knowledge base from multiple disciplines. In recognition of
this, the elementary teacher licensure program at Coe College consists
of two components: content knowledge gained from the liberal arts
classes and pedagogy learned in EDU courses. This program of
undergraduate preparation to teach in elementary schools is intended to
promote exploration and a balanced education drawn from a variety of
fields.

\begin{enumerate}

\textbf{NOTE}: \emph{As is true for all majors, elementary education
students are responsible for completion of Coe's general education
requirements. Careful program planning may enable either greater breadth
within the liberal arts or a deeper concentration within a specialty
discipline. Programs containing such additional concentration may
require more than four years of study.}

\subsection{ADMISSION TO THE TEACHER EDUCATION
PROGRAM}\label{admission-to-the-teacher-education-program}

The Education Department offers a major in \textbf{elementary
education}, a minor in \textbf{secondary education}, and courses leading
to three types of teacher licensure: K-6 classroom (elementary
education); 5--12 content area (secondary education) and K-12
``specials'' content area (art, music, physical education). Students
pursuing any of these options must be admitted to the Teacher Education
Program before being allowed to enroll in a practicum course or methods
course. Admission to Coe College does not guarantee admission to the
Teacher Education Program. Information related to applying to the
Teacher Education Program is found in the \emph{Guide to Teacher
Education} available from the Education Department. State of Iowa
licensure requirements specify that a minimum of 80 hours of field
experience be completed after admission to the Teacher Education Program
and prior to student teaching. Teacher Education Program applications
are available online; contact your Education advisor. The Teacher
Education Committee has responsibility for review of the Teacher
Education Program, including admission of students into the program. In
reviewing applications for admission to the program, the committee
considers the following: 1. A ``C'' or better in two core EDU courses
(EDU 105 Foundations of Education strongly recommended) 2. GPA (a
minimum of 2.7 is required in education core courses, courses in the
major and overall) 3. A grade of ``C'' or higher must be earned in all
courses counted toward a major or minor in education and in subject
areas in which students intend to teach. 4. Performance in education
courses taken. 5. The essay included on the program application. 6.
Other relevant information as provided by the faculty of the Education
Department and comments from faculty in classes the student is enrolled
in or has recently taken.

The Teacher Education Committee reviews applications at the conclusion
of each semester. Students are notified in writing regarding the
committee's decision. Appeals may be made to the committee in writing.
The committee evaluates such appeals on an individual basis, using its
best judgment of the student's suitability to enter the teaching
profession. The process for further appeals is detailed in the
\emph{Guide to Teacher Education}.

\subsection{Graduates/Transfers from Other
Institutions}\label{graduatestransfers-from-other-institutions}

Graduates/transfers from other institutions should submit transcripts
and all other relevant materials for review to the Education department
chair. In most cases, applicants are required to take a minimum of four
EDU courses at Coe, in which at least a 2.7 GPA or higher and a ``C'' or
better is earned, prior to student teaching. Students who received the
highest degree more than 10 years prior to application to the Teacher
Education Program must complete two additional courses at Coe in the
major area, with a grade of ``C'' or better, in addition to the required
professional education courses.

\subsection{Elementary
Education/Non-Licensure}\label{elementary-educationnon-licensure}

The majority of students who major in elementary education intend to
become licensed K--6 classroom teachers and complete one term of
full-time student teaching after completing the major requirements.
Occasionally, however, a student may wish to work with young children in
settings other than those for which certification is required. Such
students may complete all of the required coursework for the elementary
education major without student teaching and are advised on
supplementary coursework to support their goals.

\subsection{REQUIREMENTS FOR STUDENTS PURSUING TEACHING
LICENSES}\label{requirements-for-students-pursuing-teaching-licenses}

To be recommended for licensure in any of the categories listed below, a
student must have a baccalaureate degree, a cumulative GPA of at least
2.7, and at least a 2.7 GPA in each teaching field. The department can
refuse to recommend for licensure a student who has been found to have
violated the College's Academic Integrity Policy.

\subsection{Iowa Distribution Requirements for All Students Seeking
Licensure}\label{iowa-distribution-requirements-for-all-students-seeking-licensure}

According to state regulations, all teachers in Iowa ``shall acquire a
core of liberal arts knowledge including, but not limited to, English
composition, mathematics, natural sciences, social sciences, and
humanities.'' While the state's distribution requirements are consistent
with Coe's general education requirements, they are not automatically
met by these requirements. Education students should consult with their
Education advisor to coordinate this mandate with the selection of
courses for general education.

The study of English allows students to explore a wide range of literary
and cultural productions from varied parts of the world. Our courses
develop habits of mind that are fundamental to liberal education,
including the ability to read critically, to think creatively, and to
write clearly and with verve. In consultation with their advisors,
English majors are able to design personalized programs of study that
attend to the historical and geographical range of literatures in
English. Students considering graduate work in literature should consult
with English faculty to plan a rigorous course of study that would
typically include an honors thesis and coursework in a world language.

The Environmental Studies Major is a collateral, interdisciplinary
program which requires students to study environmental issues using the
techniques and perspectives from a variety of academic disciplines. In
the sophomore or junior year, a student intending to complete an
environmental studies collateral submits a proposal to the Environmental
Studies administrative coordinator, outlining the plan of study for the
major and describing plans for independent research, internship, or
off-campus study. Students seeking this collateral major should submit
this document prior to enrollment in EVS-484 Topics in Environmental
Studies. In addition to the requirements listed below, before
undertaking a practicum experience, each student is strongly encouraged
to consult with the Environmental Studies administrative coordinator to
identify a practicum experience that supports his or her study of
environmental issues. Students choosing a collateral major in
environmental studies may not select the collateral major in
environmental science.

\section{Health and Society Studies (Minor
Only)}\label{sec-health-and-society-studies}

Kelly, LeMay (Administrative Coordinators).

The Health and Society Studies program is an interdisciplinary cluster
of courses that allows students to examine the breadth of issues
impacting health and healthcare from the perspectives of natural
sciences, social sciences, and humanities. This Health and Society
Studies minor broadens students understanding of the impact of health
and healthcare delivery issues, personally, professionally, and within
our society. In addition, the minor will provide a strong
interdisciplinary foundation for students interested in graduate studies
related to health professions. Because required and elective courses are
offered by faculty across the College, students are encouraged to meet
with a Health and Society Studies administrative coordinator for
informal advising before choosing the Health and Society minor.

\subsection{Health and Society Studies
Minor}\label{health-and-society-studies-minor}

A minor in Health and Society Studies requires a minimum cumulative 2.0
GPA in all courses counted toward the minor. In addition, only (1) one

\section{International Business}\label{sec-international-business}

Students majoring in business administration have two options: the
BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION major (see
\textbf{?@sec-business-administration-and-economics}) and the
INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS major. The international business major is
designed to prepare students for specific challenges related to
operating an organization in an international context. Because of
significant overlap in the business administration and the international
business requirements, only one of the two majors may be elected by a
student.

\subsection{International Business

following: A semester abroad A May Term abroad A capstone project in
international business, supervised by a member of the business faculty

\section{Interdisciplinary Studies}\label{sec-interdisciplinary-studies}

The interdisciplinary major is a rigorous academic program in which the
individual student assumes primary responsibility for designing her or
his own academic program. Since the interdisciplinary major is
structured by the student to serve individual needs, the primary courses
selected for the major invariably cross traditional departmental
boundaries. In all instances, the interdisciplinary major must display
internal topical coherence. Assisting the student in developing a
coherent interdisciplinary major will be the supervising faculty member,
the student's academic advisor (if the advisor is not the supervising
faculty member), faculty from those departments in which the student is
taking primary courses, and the Academic Policies Committee. This
committee is responsible for approving student-initiated majors and for
offering, where necessary, constructive advice on student proposals.
Further guidelines for interdisciplinary majors may be obtained from the
Office of the Registrar. The decision to undertake and to seek approval
of an interdisciplinary major should be made after the student has had
sufficient consultation with the appropriate persons within the College.
Normally, this decision is made in the sophomore year, but in no case is
an interdisciplinary major approved after the student has embarked upon
the final eight courses leading to graduation. Application for an
interdisciplinary major must contain the following: 1) a list of the
nine to 11 primary courses which constitute the major; 2) a list of
secondary or supportive courses which are tangentially related to the
major; and 3) a three- to four-page typewritten statement of the
rationale for the proposal, indicating, among other things, the internal
coherence of the major.

\subsection{Additional guidelines and
requirements:}\label{additional-guidelines-and-requirements}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Courses for the major are selected from three or more academic
  disciplines. At least 40\% of the courses in a proposed major must be
  taken at Coe.
\item
  A student's program of study must include, among the primary and
  secondary courses listed on the proposal, at least five upper division
  classes within a single discipline or within two closely related
  disciplines. Students may consider an established, departmental minor
  when a minor appropriate to the proposed major is available. Students
  should not propose a major that simply recombines courses from majors
  and minors that will already be recognized on the student's
  transcript. An interdisciplinary major should be substantially
  distinct from the student's other majors and minors.
\item
  Students must complete an integrative senior project which
  demonstrates competence in bringing together at least two disciplines
  within the major. A student develops a project in consultation with
  the student's academic advisor and at least one other faculty
  consultant from an appropriate department other than that of the
  academic advisor. The senior project must be reviewed. The form of the
  review, which may be similar to the defense of an honors project, is
  determined by the project advisor in consultation with the student.
  The project must also be reviewed by at least one other faculty member
  from a department other than that of the faculty advisor. Students may
  undertake the project with or without academic credit. Registration
  for credit may take one of two forms. Students may register for
  regular catalog courses in individualized instruction (e.g., directed
  readings or directed writing classes) or they may apply for an
  independent study which requires approval by the Chair of the Academic
  Policies Committee (Provost).
\item
  An interdisciplinary major may include an internship.
\end{enumerate}

  interdisciplinary major.
\end{itemize}

\section{International Economics}\label{sec-international-economics}

Students majoring in economics have two options: the ECONOMICS major
(see Section~\ref{sec-economics}) and the INTERNATIONAL ECONOMICS major.
The international economics major is designed to allow students who are
interested in international studies to explore issues of development,
growth, and international finance, using the tools of economic analysis.
Because of significant overlap in the economics and the international
economics requirements, only one of the two majors may be elected by a
student. Students majoring in economics or international economics may
not minor in either economics or international economics.

\subsection{Senior Seminar Course}\label{senior-seminar-course}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{LIT 464 Seminar in World Literature} Required of all
  literature majors in the senior year. While the subject changes from
  year to year, the seminar explores how literature from different
  countries relates to other human activities and disciplines. Thus, the
  emphasis may be on a historical period (literature and politics in the
  Renaissance); on an interdisciplinary topic (literature and Freudian
  analysis); or on a cross-cultural mix (literature, games and play).
  When the number of senior majors is too small to justify offering the
  seminar, other arrangements are made for majors to satisfy this
  requirement: either independent study or participation in an English
  department seminar, with the stipulation that the term paper be on a
  topic in comparative literature.

Bursch (Chair), Dehner, Guthrie, Kittrell, Siems, Umbarger-Mackey

A description of policies unique to the nursing department is in the
\emph{Nursing Department Student Policies Manual}. Copies of the manual
are available in the Nursing Department Office, Stuart Hall 415, and
online.

\subsection{The Bachelor of Science in Nursing
Program}\label{the-bachelor-of-science-in-nursing-program}

The baccalaureate nursing program is designed to prepare students for
practice as professional nurses in a variety of settings. The upper
division nursing courses draw upon broad and diverse knowledge gained
from the liberal arts foundation to support the educational outcomes.

Clinical experiences in the program include working with clients across
the age span in a wide spectrum of practice sites. Nurse preceptors are
utilized at clinical sites to provide the maximum amount of individual
supervision and educational opportunity to students. Coe College nursing
faculty provide clinical expertise and education by overseeing student
clinical experiences, evaluating and promoting preceptor performance,
and engaging in ongoing dialogue with students regarding the application
of theory into practice.

Graduates of the Bachelor of Science in Nursing degree program are
eligible to take the state board licensing examination for Registered
Nurses. They are also eligible for admission to graduate programs in
nursing and to advanced nurse practitioner programs. The Coe College
nursing program is approved by the Iowa Board of Nursing and accredited
by the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education (CCNE).

Coe College offers two paths to enter the nursing program. Standard
entry is for sophomore level (or higher) college students and direct
entry is for selected high school seniors. Details for both plans are
found in the \emph{Nursing Department Student Policies Manual}. Copies
of the manual are available in the Nursing Department Office. At the end
of the sophomore year, a student must possess valid licensure,
e.g.~Licensed Practical Nurse (LPN) or Certified Nursing Assistant
(Direct Care Worker). A student with a revoked license from any state
will NOT be admitted into the nursing program. In addition, a clinical
component may not be taken by a person: a) who had been denied licensure
by the State Board of Nursing, b) whose licensure is currently
suspended, surrendered or revoked in any United States jurisdiction, c)
whose licensure/ registration is currently suspended, surrendered or
revoked in another country due to disciplinary action.

The nursing department Admission, Promotion, and Retention committee
reviews applications and selects candidates who are best qualified to
meet the standards of the nursing profession. Admission to the BSN
degree program is competitive. Those applicants who appear to be the
most qualified will be admitted. Standard and direct entry students are
expected to maintain the eligibility requirements as outlined in the
\emph{Nursing Department Student Policies Manual}.

\subsection{Departmental Notes:}\label{departmental-notes-1}

In order to successfully complete a course and be promoted to successive
courses, students must:

\begin{verbatim}
- Achieve a minimum grade of C (2.0) in all nursing courses; a grade of C- (1.7) or lower requires the student to repeat the course.
- Achieve a cumulative average of 72% on all exams in a given course.

\textbf{Category A: General Introductions}

The following courses, all numbered PHL-105, are different versions of
the same course. They share overlapping content and focus on the
development of the same skills. Students can receive credit for only one
PHL 105 Introduction to Philosophy: course. - \textbf{PHL 105
Introduction to Philosophy:} Minds: Examines what philosophers think
about some of the most basic questions in life. What is real? What does
it mean to have a mind? Could minds have an existence independent from
our bodies? Is there anything we can know with absolute certainty? Are
there objective moral values, and if so, could we know what they are?
May not be taken more than once for credit.

God: Focuses on questions about the nature and existence of God, human
nature, personhood, and free will. Is there evidence for the existence
of God and is the presence of suffering inthe world consistent with
God's existence? Are human beings merely material beings or might we
have non-physical minds or souls? What are persons and what constitutes
personal identity over time? What does it mean to have free will? Do we
possess free will? May not be taken more than once for credit.

Masterworks: Central philosophical debates encountered though the
examination of important classical and modern texts from the history of
philosophy. Readings in the course focus on several major works from
philosophers such as Plato, Descartes, Hume, Marx, and Sartre who
discuss the meaning of life, belief in God, the mind-body problem,
relativism of truth, and other important philosophical concerns. May not
be taken more than once for credit.

Science Fiction: Uses science fiction as a springboard for thinking
about classic issues and problems in philosophy. Sci-fi classics such as
The Matrix, Bladerunner, and Surrogates, raise fundamental philosophical
questions such as: What the difference between appearance and reality
and how can we distinguish between them? What is it to be a person?
Should we think that all and only human beings can be person? What is a
good human life? Is a pleasant life sufficient for living a good life?
In this course such questions are examined through the lens of both
philosophy and science fiction. May not be taken more than once for
credit.\\

God's existence? Are human beings merely material beings or might we
have non-physical minds or souls? What are persons and what constitutes
personal identity over time? What does it mean to have free will? Do we
possess free will? May not be taken more than once for credit.

Masterworks: Central philosophical debates encountered though the
examination of important classical and modern texts from the history of
philosophy. Readings in the course focus on several major works from

\section{Psychology}\label{sec-psychology}

Baker, Brown, Castillo, Chihak, Farrell (Chair, Fall), Kelly (Chair,
Spring), Lee, Recker, Stephenson

Psychology is the scientific study of behavior and mental
processes---the basis for both a field of scientific knowledge and of
professional application. Both required and elective courses in
psychology are grounded in the scientific approach. As an important tool
for the understanding of both theory and data, the study of basic
statistical and methodological concepts is included among courses
required of all students majoring in psychology.

In addition to a major in \textbf{Psychology}, the College also offers
collateral majors in \textbf{Neuroscience} (see
Section~\ref{sec-neuroscience} ) and \textbf{Organizational Science}
(see Section~\ref{sec-organizational-science} ).

\section{Rhetoric}\label{rhetoric}

Carr (Chair), Donofrio, Harmsen, J. Nesmith, Opayemi, Spikes

The Rhetoric Department offers a major and a minor in both
\textbf{Communication Studies} (see \textbf{?@sec-communication-studies}
) and \textbf{Writing} (see \textbf{?@sec-writing} ) and is responsible
for offering courses in the study and practice of academic prose,
non-fiction writing, journalism, and communication studies.

\section{Social \& Criminal Justice}\label{social-criminal-justice}

L. Barnett, J. Christensen, Lemos, McNabb (Administrative Coordinator).

The Social \& Criminal Justice Program offers students an opportunity to
immerse themselves in an interdisciplinary major that draws from Coe's
rich tradition in the liberal arts, as well as the pre-professional
opportunities at the college. Core courses in the major address
multifaceted questions surrounding restorative, retributive, procedural,
and distributive justice. While many programs addressing such issues are
housed in the field of criminal justice studies, the SCJ faculty teach
topics within the major from varying perspectives and disciplines,
introducing students to the ways in which matters of justice are at work
in --- and essential to --- many areas of study.

The major is both local and global in nature, exhibiting the
possibilities and limitations of social and criminal justice initiatives
in the Cedar Rapids community, while also navigating matters of human
rights and comparative justice systems that reveal our connections to
the broader world.

Through interdisciplinary engagement and a required practicum, the SCJ
program demonstrates for students how a multiplicity of voices and
viewpoints can help to shape new ideas about the impact of social
justice initiatives upon the criminal justice system, and the
foundations of individual and collective community engagement.

Wolverton (Chair)

The Theatre Arts program is designed to provide a balance between
academic and experiential learning for all interested students. The goal
is to offer opportunities for student participation in all aspects of
theatre, on stage and in the classroom, and to enrich the cultural and
academic life of the College.

The program accommodates both majors and minors through courses focused
on theatrical history, theory and literature, as well as through
training in acting, directing, design, and theatrical production. This
foundation prepares students for graduate study and for any field that
values high-level communication skills, as well as for careers in
theatre as teachers, artists, technicians, or managers.

As a means of helping students prepare for graduate study and/or a
professional career, all majors are required to present an audition
piece or a portfolio for annual review beginning in their second year.
The senior seminar provides a capstone experience, giving students an
opportunity to reflect on their development as theatre artists, and to
examine theatre as a collaborative art form.

For the campus community at large, as audience members or as occasional
participants, the program offers a wide range of drama selected both to
educate and to entertain.
