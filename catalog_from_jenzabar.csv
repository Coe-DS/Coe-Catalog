Working from the premise that sexual(ized) identities are at least partially socially constructed, we will examine the ways that sexual identities have co-evolved through science and media. We will draw theoretical muscle from feminist science studies, LGBTIQ studies, media studies, critical race theory, crip theory, feminism and queer theory. Students will read scholarship from the 1960s through the present, as well as analyze cultural artifacts such as web and print advertisements, television shows, films and fiction.

2014:  Writing About Baseball: A West Coast Baseball Travel Course
Two road trips, a short road trip to see Major and Minor League games in the Midwest, followed by an 18-day road trip to the West Coast, aiming to see 15 games during that trip will be scheduled. A major focus of this course is considering the respective design of different ball parks and how their design can influence our experience at these games.  Since there is more good writing on baseball than all other American spots combined, students will read a healthy sampling of that literature. Some readings explore the history of baseball and the cultural/social/economic roles the game has fulfilled in American culture since the 1850s. An appreciable portion of the class will be spent on collaborative writing projects.  Estimated cost:  $1950

It helps performers to trust in the idea of “letting something occur” onstage rather than “making it occur,” since they are led to understand that the source of action and invention comes to each of them from the others, as well as from the physical world around them.  The Viewpoints—nine in all, divided into Viewpoints of Time (Tempo, Duration, Repetition, and Kinesthetic Response) and Viewpoints of Space (Shape, Gesture, Architecture, Topography, and Spatial Relationship)—serve as a foundation for a physical vocabulary and constitute a language for talking about what happens between actors onstage.

Narrative medicine empowers both patients and healthcare professionals through giving voice to their unique experiences, bridging communication gaps, and contributing to a more humane clinical practice overall. It recognizes that the healthcare journey often begins with listening and interpreting patients’ tales of illness or distress. The transformative nature of narrative understanding allows empathy with the other as one walks in the shoes of those who hail from different racial, religious, cultural, or socio-economic backgrounds.

The class will read select essays, poetry, and prose by authors writing as both medical practitioners – William Carlos Williams, Anton Chekhov, Rita Charon – or patients – Joan Didion, Susan Sontag, Eula Biss; covering diverse issues such as the human body, the sickbed experience, race-based treatment, medical ethics, and palliative care. Through a rigorous schedule of readings, in-class exercises, writing assignments, and thoughtful discussion; students can expect to enhance their active listening skills, deepen understanding of narrative ethics, master reflective writing techniques, and enrich effectiveness of care.

Students in this course will study, experience, and write about the literature, music, theatre, and history of the area.  

The first part of the course will be spent at the Fowey Festival of Words and Music, an annual event that features writing workshops, lectures by authors, discussion groups, and musical performances. Other components of the trip include a visit to Tintagel, the legendary birthplace of King Arthur, to Llanhydrock, a restored Victorian manor house and to the National Maritime Museum.  A significant portion of the course will be spent on individual and collaborative writing projects.

They engage in participant observation, visual sociology, interviewing, oral history, and archival research in the wilderness region known by the Ojibway as the “Arrowhead”, around the Boundary Waters Canoe Wilderness Area in the United States and Quetico Provincial Park in Canada. Students visit four reservations and four small towns on both sides of the border to interview community leaders, business leaders, environmental groups, nongovernmental organizations, and government officials. Their research sheds light on the history of environmental preservation, environmental law-making at the grassroots, race relations, different models of economic development, environmental and social justice, and the role of Ojibway communities and government in wilderness preservation. Cross-national comparisons of political institutions, regulatory styles, Ojibway customary law, and state-society relations reveal different approaches to environmental management and wilderness preservation in Canada and the U.S. The course is designed for undergraduate students with an interest in environmental studies, political science, social justice, race relations, environmental law, and social research methods.

God:
Focuses on questions about the nature and existence of God, human nature, personhood, and free will. Is there evidence for the existence of God and is the presence of suffering inthe world consistent with God's existence? Are human beings merely material beings or might we have non-physical minds or souls? What are persons and what constitutes personal identity over time? What does it mean to have free will?

Masterworks:
Central philosophical debates encountered though the examination of important classical and modern texts from the history of philosophy.

Science Fiction:

What is wilderness? Who made it? Whose land is it? How should we relate to it? Students in this course develop the tools to answer these questions by conducting their own field research. They engage in participant observation, visual sociology, interviewing, oral history, and archival research in the wilderness region known by the Ojibway as the “Arrowhead”, around the Boundary Waters Canoe Wilderness Area in the United States and Quetico Provincial Park in Canada. Students visit four reservations and four small towns on both sides of the border to interview community leaders, business leaders, environmental groups, nongovernmental organizations, and government officials. Their research sheds light on the history of environmental preservation, environmental law-making at the grassroots, race relations, different models of economic development, environmental and social justice, and the role of Ojibway communities and government in wilderness preservation. Cross-national comparisons of political institutions, regulatory styles, Ojibway customary law, and state-society relations reveal different approaches to environmental management and wilderness preservation in Canada and the U.S. The course is designed for undergraduate students with an interest in environmental studies, political science, social justice, race relations, environmental law, and social research methods.

—SOCIAL & CRIMINAL JUSTICE
L. Barnett (Administrative Coordinator)
The Social & Criminal Justice Program offers students an opportunity to immerse themselves in an interdisciplinary major that draws from Coe’s rich tradition in the liberal arts, as well as the pre-professional opportunities at the college. Core courses in the major address multifaceted questions surrounding restorative, retributive, procedural, and distributive justice. While many programs addressing such issues are housed in the field of criminal justice studies, the SCJ faculty teach topics within the major from varying perspectives and disciplines, introducing students to the ways in which matters of justice are at work in — and essential to — many areas of study.
The major is both local and global in nature, exhibiting the possibilities and limitations of social and criminal justice initiatives in the Cedar Rapids community, while also navigating matters of human rights and comparative justice systems that reveal our connections to the broader world.
Through interdisciplinary engagement and a required practicum, the SCJ program demonstrates for students how a multiplicity of voices and viewpoints can help to shape new ideas about the impact of social justice initiatives upon the criminal justice system, and the foundations of individual and collective community engagement.

Introduces students to the testimonial literature in Latin America, a genre capable of allowing the oppressed to bring forward their perceptions, world view, and experience of a specific historical moment. This class includes narratives from Guatemala, Nicaragua, El Salvador, México, and Bolivia, among others. It will also include a theoretical segment that will reflect on
the advantages and shortcomings of this genre. At the end of the class, students understand and describe major social problems during specific time frames in the 20th century of the nations studied, articulate the characteristics of this genre, and use a testimonio to gain an insight into a sociohistorical event.
