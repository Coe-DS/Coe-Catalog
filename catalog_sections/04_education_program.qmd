# THE ACADEMIC CALENDAR
The academic year consists of three terms (see Academic Calendar, p. 15).  Students normally take four course credits in the Fall Term and four course credits in the Spring Term. Thus, eight course credits are completed in an academic year.  During optional May Term, students may enroll for up to one course credit in one of the limited selection of courses.  Summer term is limited in scope and is not considered a regular term. (The maximum course load is described in Course Load, p. 53).
