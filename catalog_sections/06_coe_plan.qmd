# COE PLAN {#sec-coe-plan}

Coe College’s requirements for graduation, commonly known as the Coe Plan were developed with the following outcomes in mind:

- Creation of a bridge from high school to Coe College that helps students understand the importance of a liberal arts education, the ways to develop the skills needed by any learner, and the opportunities they will have by going to Coe College.
- Development of required curriculum that exposes the students to ways of learning in various contexts, big ideas in a myriad of disciplines, ways of being and understanding of cultures around the world, and processes to develop the skills needed by any learner.
- Creation of a bridge from Coe College to life after Coe.

These outcomes are met through the College’s First-Year Experience, General Education program, Writing Emphasis courses, and the College’s Practicum experiences and areas of study, described in this section of the Catalog.
