## Chemistry {#sec-chemistry}

Ibrahim, Noreuil, St. Clair (Chair), Singleton, Stead, Stoudt.

The chemistry department seeks to support Coe's mission by providing students with top-quality instruction and research opportunities.  The department offers a major and minor in [**chemistry**]{.smallcaps} as well as collateral majors in [**biochemistry**]{.smallcaps} (see p. 66), [**environmental science**]{.smallcaps} (see p. 115), and [**neuroscience**]{.smallcaps} (see p. 156).  Students considering a chemistry major may continue research in a graduate program, pursue a career in the health sciences or teach science at the secondary level.

Students who receive a grade of less than "C--" in a prerequisite course are expected to consult with the instructor of the subsequent course prior to continuing in the chemistry curriculum.

In addition to a major in [**chemistry**]{.smallcaps}, the chemistry department also offers an [**American chemical society certified chemistry major**]{.smallcaps} (see p. 87). This major might be considered by students interested in chemistry as a career.

### Chemistry Major 
A major in chemistry requires a minimum cumulative 2.0 GPA in all courses counted toward the major.
