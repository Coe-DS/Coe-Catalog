## Environmental Studies (Collateral Major) {#sec-environmental-studies}
St. Clair (Administrative Coordinator).

The Environmental Studies Major is a collateral, interdisciplinary program which requires students to study environmental issues using the techniques and perspectives from a variety of academic disciplines.  
In the sophomore or junior year, a student intending to complete an environmental studies collateral submits a proposal to the Environmental Studies administrative coordinator, outlining the plan of study for the major and describing plans for independent research, internship, or off-campus study. Students seeking this collateral major should submit this document prior to enrollment in EVS-484 Topics in Environmental Studies.   
In addition to the requirements listed below, before undertaking a practicum experience, each student is strongly encouraged to consult with the Environmental Studies administrative coordinator to identify a practicum experience that supports his or her study of environmental issues.  
Students choosing a collateral major in environmental studies may not select the collateral major in environmental science.
