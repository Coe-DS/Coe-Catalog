### International Studies Major — The Global South track
The Global South examines the characteristics of regions in what has come to be called the “Global South,” especially Latin America, Africa, and Asia.  It investigates how the evolution of these regions relates to social, political and economic systems.  Students are introduced to a variety of disciplinary and theoretical approaches to the study of international development; graduates better understand the history and legacy of colonialism, the conditions that create or resolve poverty, and relations between the Global South and North.
