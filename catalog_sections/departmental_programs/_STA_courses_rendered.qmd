### Courses in Statistics 

- **STA 100 Statistical Reasoning I-Foundations**
  A hands-on introduction to the use of statistical techniques. Provides a foundation for statistical analysis and introduces the basic concepts involved in data collection and presentation. (0.5 course credit) (Offered first 7 weeks of Term)  
- **STA 105 Probability: A World of Chance**
  An introduction to probability and its applications in our world. This hands-on course examines how probability techniques can be used to understand topics in science, government, recreation, and communication. Bizarre events in everyday life are also discussed. This course is appropriate for a varied audience. Some ability in arithmetic and elementary algebra is assumed. This course does not satisfy any of the requirements for a major or minor in the mathematical sciences.
- **STA 110 Stats IIA: Inferential Reasoning**
  A continuation of Statistical Reasoning I (STA-100), presenting a broad range of data analysis techniques. Topics covered include hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, Chi-square tests, and regression. Emphasis is on a project-based approach to analyzing data. Prerequisite: Statistical Reasoning I (STA-100) or consent of instructor. (0.5 course credit) (Offered second seven weeks of Term)
- **STA 130 Stats IIB: Experimental Design**
