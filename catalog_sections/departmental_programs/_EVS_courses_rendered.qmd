## Environmental Studies (Collateral Major) {#sec-environmental-studies}
St. Clair (Administrative Coordinator).

The Environmental Studies Major is a collateral, interdisciplinary program which requires students to study environmental issues using the techniques and perspectives from a variety of academic disciplines.  
In the sophomore or junior year, a student intending to complete an environmental studies collateral submits a proposal to the Environmental Studies administrative coordinator, outlining the plan of study for the major and describing plans for independent research, internship, or off-campus study. Students seeking this collateral major should submit this document prior to enrollment in EVS-484 Topics in Environmental Studies.   
In addition to the requirements listed below, before undertaking a practicum experience, each student is strongly encouraged to consult with the Environmental Studies administrative coordinator to identify a practicum experience that supports his or her study of environmental issues.  
Students choosing a collateral major in environmental studies may not select the collateral major in environmental science.

### Courses in Environmental Studies (Collateral Major) 
 **BUS 170 Bus Sustainability & Environment**  
  Examines the global trend of the increasing attention organizations are giving to environmental and sustainability issues, including evaluation of successful business practices being pursued by leading corporations. Consideration is given to why and how corporations are embracing such trends. Topics covered include eco-labeling, corporate environmental strategies, NGO-business partnerships, and emerging markets for environmental goods and services. Significant attention is given to global warming concerns and the emerging strategies for measuring and reducing the carbon footprint of business.   
 **ECO 195 Prin of Environmental Economics**  
  An introduction to the economics of the environment and natural resource allocation. This course is focused on optimal resource allocation and the problems associated with externalities and public goods in the context of a market economy. Environmental issues and policy are analyzed using standard economic models. This course may be used to satisfy the requirements for a major in Environmental Studies but does not satisfy any of the requirements for a major or minor in economics. Prerequisite: Principles of Macroeconomics (ECO-175).   
 **EVS 112 Environmental Law and Policy**  
  An introduction to the law and surrounding policies pertaining to environmental issues such as pollution, population, economic growth, and energy. The course focuses on the analysis of existing federal statutory efforts, such as the National Environmental Policy Act, the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. Attention is also given to environmental enforcement issues and the role of the regulatory agency.   
 **EVS 137 Environmental Law: The Wilderness Act and the Battle Over the Boundary Waters**  
  An introduction to environmental law and the effort to control the effects of human activity on land and water. After an overview of basic environmental law covering property rights and wilderness protection, the class applies the same to the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness (BWCAW), local communities, recreation, and use of the area. Significant time is spent on the legislative efforts to establish the BWCAW and subsequent judicial interpretation of those laws. Multiple trips to areas of different preservation status are taken to help evaluate the practical effects of the disparate levels of protection. (Offered summers at the Wilderness Field Station)   
 **EVS 484 Topics in Environmental Studies**  
  An intensive examination of selected works and subjects dealing with environmental issues. Specific topics vary from year to year. Prerequisite: junior standing or permission of instructor. May be taken more than once for credit with permission of instructor.
