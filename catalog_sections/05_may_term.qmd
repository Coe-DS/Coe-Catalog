# MAY TERM (OPTIONAL) 

Students may enroll for up to one course credit during May Term in one of the limited selection of courses.  All May Term courses require consent of instructor prior to registration.
May Term courses are designed to meet at least two of the following shared learning outcomes:

- Evaluate and engage with complex interdependent systems and demonstrate understanding across diverse contexts.
- Critically describe and break apart issues or problems through systematic analysis and illustrate logic for conclusions.
- Engage with experiential learning practices such as learning by doing, while utilizing abilities to think critically, problem solve and make connections between knowledge gained in the classroom and experience beyond.

May Term courses are expected to have the same amount of contact time and academic rigor per course credit as courses which meet over a Fall or Spring Term.  For every 1 course credit of May term students are expected to complete 140 hours of work.  Such contact time includes class meetings, lectures by the instructor, supervised course related activities and independent out of class activities.  Off-campus May Term courses at an off-campus location provide certain educational benefits through site visits, guest lectures, etc., that also contribute to the contact time for the course.
