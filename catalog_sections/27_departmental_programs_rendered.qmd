## Business Administration and Economics   {#sec-business-administration-and-economics}
Baranowski, Carstens, Chen, J. Christensen, Crain, Eichhorn (Co-Chair), Hall, Hayes, D., Knudson, Kuennen, Melcher, Nguyen (Co-Chair), Perry, Trout, Westberg.

The Stead Department of Business Administration and Economics offers majors in **ACCOUNTING**, **BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION**, **ECONOMICS**, **INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS**, and INTERNATIONAL ECONOMICS, and minors in economics and international economics. Students pursuing one or more of these are strongly encouraged to consult with departmental faculty to develop specific plans of study. 

### BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION  
The study of business administration is designed to develop in its students a high degree of competence in the application of business theories and sound judgment to the solution of business operating problems. Graduates are able to contribute effectively to the activities of their organizations by applying business skills required to plan, analyze, and control company activities. Beyond enhancing the value of a firm, the graduate should have a firm knowledge from which to achieve professional growth in the workplace and/or graduate school. Students majoring in business administration have two options: the business administration major and the international business major (see @sec-international-business). The business major is designed to prepare students in the core areas of business administration, with specific focus on management, finance, and marketing. Students are also provided the opportunity to specialize in a particular area through selection of elective courses. The international business major is designed to prepare students for specific challenges related to operating an organization in an international context.   
Because of significant overlap in the business administration and the international business requirements, only one of the two majors may be elected by a student.  See @sec-international-business for the International Business major requirements.

## Accounting {#sec-accounting}

Students majoring in accounting have two options: the managerial accounting major and the public accounting major. The managerial accounting major is designed for students interested in pursuing a career in private industry or the not-for-profit sector. The public accounting major is designed for students interested in practicing public accounting and those desiring the Certified Public Accounting (CPA) designation. Because of the identical core course requirements in the managerial accounting and public accounting majors, only one of the two majors can be elected by a student. A student receiving a managerial accounting major may pursue a post-baccalaureate major in public accounting, but when completed, the public accounting major would replace the managerial accounting major in the student’s records. 

Requirements for becoming a CPA differ from state to state. All states require that students pass the Uniform CPA examination and many require the completion of 150 semester hours of education prior to certification. The 150 hours can be completed in undergraduate or graduate programs. To become a CPA in Iowa, the Iowa State Board of Accountancy requires that students pass the CPA examination, complete 150 semester hours of education, and complete specified course work in accounting and business subjects. Students majoring in accounting, business, or economics are required to have a minimum of 24 of their 150 semester hours in financial accounting, auditing, taxation, and management accounting courses above the elementary level. If students majoring in any other field wish to become a CPA in Iowa, they must, in addition, complete at least 24 semester hours in business-related courses (not including internships). (One course credit completed at Coe is counted as four semester hours.)  Accounting students at Coe should work closely with faculty in the department to determine their plan of study. Students wishing to become a CPA should also check the state board’s education requirements for the state in which they wish to practice.

Students wishing to prepare for the examination to become a Certified Public Accountant should select the Public Accounting major, which meets the guidelines for the breadth of business and accounting courses recommended by The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. Students at Coe can meet the 150-semester hour requirement by completing 37.5 credits.

If degree requirements are not completed by the end of four years, students pursuing a major in public accounting, who are in good academic standing, and who are full-time students, receive a 60% discount on tuition in the consecutive fifth year. They continue to be eligible to apply for student loans and any available federal and state government grants

## ECONOMICS
Economics is a social science concerning the study of how economic agents make choices in the face of scarcity. Economists study a broad variety of topics ranging from the theory of the consumer to economic growth and the wealth of nations. Students majoring in economics have two options: the economics major and the international economics major (see @sec-international-economics). The economics major is designed to permit a broad enough selection of courses for students to develop a general competence in economics, and to prepare students for graduate work in economics or other disciplines, such as law or business. The international economics major is designed to allow students who are interested in international studies to explore issues of development, growth, and international finance, using the tools of economic analysis.  
Because of significant overlap in the economics and the international economics requirements, only one of the two majors may be elected by a student. Students majoring in economics or international economics may not minor in either economics or international economics.  See @sec-international-economics for the International Economics major and minor requirements.

Coe College believes that the most effective preparation for teaching is one that combines a liberal arts education with courses in the theory and practice of teaching. The Education Department has the responsibility for coordinating the efforts of the College to provide such a program.  

Basic college requirements and those for a major area give students a well-rounded general education. Professional courses in education provide a foundation in principles and practices of teaching. Students gain practical experience in applying professional and general education through field experiences and, if pursuing licensure, through student teaching in area schools. 

Students who successfully complete Coe’s Teacher Education Program and student teaching are eligible to apply for an Iowa Initial Teacher License. Teaching licensure is governed by State of Iowa regulations. When changes in licensure requirements occur at the state level, they take precedence over College policies. For the most current policy information, students should consult the *Guide to Teacher Education*, available from the Education Department. The Education Department maintains records regarding Iowa licensure requirements. Students should consult a faculty member in the Education Department to arrange their respective courses of study. 

The Teacher Education Program at Coe College is approved by the Iowa Department of Education. Copies of the annual report filed with the Iowa Department of Education are available on request.


### Elementary Education Major
Teachers in elementary schools function as generalists who must draw upon a broad knowledge base from multiple disciplines. In recognition of this, the elementary teacher licensure program at Coe College consists of two components: content knowledge gained from the liberal arts classes and pedagogy learned in EDU courses. This program of undergraduate preparation to teach in elementary schools is intended to promote exploration and a balanced education drawn from a variety of fields. 

1. At least one course in each of the four fields of mathematics, natural sciences, social sciences, and humanities. **Iowa Distribution Requirements** - a “C” or better in the following courses:
	- **One** mathematics course with a prefix of MTH or STA
	- **One** American History course
	- **One** lab science in BIO or PHY-114 Modern Astronomy
	- **One** social science course with a prefix of ANT, ECO, POL, PSY, or SOC

2. A K–8 endorsement in Art, English/Language Arts, French, Spanish, Health, History, Mathematics, Music, Physical Education, Reading, Science, Social Studies, or Speech Communication and Theater.

3. GPA of 2.7 or higher and a “C” or better in the following professional education courses:
	- EDU 105 Foundations of Education

### ADMISSION TO THE TEACHER EDUCATION PROGRAM
The Education Department offers a major in **elementary education**, a minor in **secondary education**, and courses leading to three types of teacher licensure: K-6 classroom (elementary education); 5–12 content area (secondary education) and K-12 “specials” content area (art, music, physical education). Students pursuing any of these options must be admitted to the Teacher Education Program before being allowed to enroll in a practicum course or methods course. Admission to Coe College does not guarantee admission to the Teacher Education Program. Information related to applying to the Teacher Education Program is found in the *Guide to Teacher Education* available from the Education Department. 

State of Iowa licensure requirements specify that a minimum of 80 hours of field experience be completed after admission to the Teacher Education Program and prior to student teaching. Teacher Education Program applications are available online; contact your Education advisor. 

The Teacher Education Committee has responsibility for review of the Teacher Education Program, including admission of students into the program. In reviewing applications for admission to the program, the committee considers the following: 

1. A “C” or better in two core EDU courses (EDU 105 Foundations of Education strongly recommended)
2. GPA (a minimum of 2.7 is required in education core courses, courses in the major and overall)
3. A grade of “C” or higher must be earned in all courses counted toward a major or minor in education and in subject areas in which students intend to teach. 
4. Performance in education courses taken. 
5. The essay included on the program application.
6. Other relevant information as provided by the faculty of the Education Department and comments from faculty in classes the student is enrolled in or has recently taken.

The Teacher Education Committee reviews applications at the conclusion of each semester. Students are notified in writing regarding the committee’s decision. Appeals may be made to the committee in writing. The committee evaluates such appeals on an individual basis, using its best judgment of the student’s suitability to enter the teaching profession. The process for further appeals is detailed in the *Guide to Teacher Education*.


### Graduates/Transfers from Other Institutions
Graduates/transfers from other institutions should submit transcripts and all other relevant materials for
review to the Education department chair. In most cases, applicants are required to take a minimum of four EDU courses at Coe, in which at least a 2.7 GPA or higher and a “C” or better is earned, prior to student teaching. 
Students who received the highest degree more than 10 years prior to application to the Teacher Education Program must complete two additional courses at Coe in the major area, with a grade of “C” or better, in addition to the required professional education courses. 


### Elementary Education/Non-Licensure
The majority of students who major in elementary education intend to become licensed K–6 classroom teachers and complete one term of full-time student teaching after completing the major requirements. Occasionally, however, a student may wish to work with young children in settings other than those for which certification is required. Such students may complete all of the required coursework for the elementary education major without student teaching and are advised on supplementary coursework to support their goals.


### REQUIREMENTS FOR STUDENTS PURSUING TEACHING LICENSES
To be recommended for licensure in any of the categories listed below, a student must have a baccalaureate degree, a cumulative GPA of at least 2.7, and at least a 2.7 GPA in each teaching field. The department can refuse to recommend for licensure a student who has been found to have violated the College’s Academic Integrity Policy.  


### Iowa Distribution Requirements for All Students Seeking Licensure
According to state regulations, all teachers in Iowa “shall acquire a core of liberal arts knowledge including, but not limited to, English composition, mathematics, natural sciences, social sciences, and humanities.” While the state’s distribution requirements are consistent with Coe’s general education requirements, they are not automatically met by these requirements. Education students should consult with their Education advisor to coordinate this mandate with the selection of courses for general education.

Our courses develop habits of mind that are fundamental to liberal education, including the ability to read critically, to think creatively, and to write clearly and with verve.

In consultation with their advisors, English majors are able to design personalized programs of study that attend to the historical and geographical range of literatures in English.

## Health and Society Studies (Minor Only) {#sec-health-and-society-studies}
Kelly, LeMay (Administrative Coordinators).

The Health and Society Studies program is an interdisciplinary cluster of courses that allows students to examine the breadth of issues impacting health and healthcare from the perspectives of natural sciences, social sciences, and humanities.  This Health and Society Studies minor broadens students understanding of the impact of health and healthcare delivery issues, personally, professionally, and within our society.  In addition, the minor will provide a strong interdisciplinary foundation for students interested in graduate studies related to health professions.

Students majoring in business administration have two options: the BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION major (see @sec-business-administration-and-economics) and the INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS major. The international business major is designed to prepare students for specific challenges related to operating an organization in an international context. Because of significant overlap in the business administration and the international business requirements, only one of the two majors may be elected by a student.

## Interdisciplinary Studies {#sec-interdisciplinary-studies} 

The interdisciplinary major is a rigorous academic program in which the individual student assumes primary responsibility for designing her or his own academic program. Since the interdisciplinary major is structured by the student to serve individual needs, the primary courses selected for the major invariably cross traditional departmental boundaries. In all instances, the interdisciplinary major must display internal topical coherence. Assisting the student in developing a coherent interdisciplinary major will be the supervising faculty member, the student’s academic advisor (if the advisor is not the supervising faculty member), faculty from those departments in which the student is taking primary courses, and the Academic Policies Committee. This committee is responsible for approving student-initiated majors and for offering, where necessary, constructive advice on student proposals. Further guidelines for interdisciplinary majors may be obtained from the Office of the Registrar. The decision to undertake and to seek approval of an interdisciplinary major should be made after the student has had sufficient consultation with the appropriate persons within the College. Normally, this decision is made in the sophomore year, but in no case is an interdisciplinary major approved after the student has embarked upon the final eight courses leading to graduation. Application for an interdisciplinary major must contain the following: 1) a list of the nine to 11 primary courses which constitute the major; 2) a list of secondary or supportive courses which are tangentially related to the major; and 3) a three- to four-page typewritten statement of the rationale for the proposal, indicating, among other things, the internal coherence of the major. 

### Additional guidelines and requirements: 
1. Courses for the major are selected from three or more academic disciplines. At least 40% of the courses in a proposed major must be taken at Coe. 
2. A student’s program of study must include, among the primary and secondary courses listed on the proposal, at least five upper division classes within a single discipline or within two closely related disciplines. Students may consider an established, departmental minor when a minor appropriate to the proposed major is available. Students should not propose a major that simply recombines courses from majors and minors that will already be recognized on the student’s transcript. An interdisciplinary major should be substantially distinct from the student’s other majors and minors. 
3. Students must complete an integrative senior project which demonstrates competence in bringing together at least two disciplines within the major. A student develops a project in consultation with the student’s academic advisor and at least one other faculty consultant from an appropriate department other than that of the academic advisor. The senior project must be reviewed. The form of the review, which may be similar to the defense of an honors project, is determined by the project advisor in consultation with the student. The project must also be reviewed by at least one other faculty member from a department other than that of the faculty advisor. Students may undertake the project with or without academic credit. Registration for credit may take one of two forms. Students may register for regular catalog courses in individualized instruction (e.g., directed readings or directed writing classes) or they may apply for an independent study which requires approval by the Chair of the Academic Policies Committee (Provost). 
4. An interdisciplinary major may include an internship. 


### Courses in Interdisciplinary Studies
- **INT 494 Internship**
  An internship related to the student’s field of interdisciplinary study supervised by the Internship Specialist. A minimum of 140 hours on-site experience is required. S/U basis only. Prerequisites: junior standing and approval of an interdisciplinary major. 














## International Economics {#sec-international-economics}
Students majoring in economics have two options: the ECONOMICS major (see @sec-economics) and the INTERNATIONAL ECONOMICS major. The international economics major is designed to allow students who are interested in international studies to explore issues of development, growth, and international finance, using the tools of economic analysis. Because of significant overlap in the economics and the international economics requirements, only one of the two majors may be elected by a student. Students majoring in economics or international economics may not minor in either economics or international economics.

### International Economics Major
1. ECO 175 Principles of Macroeconomics
2. ECO 215 Prin Microeconomics
3. ECO 315 Intermediate Macroeconomic Theory
4. ECO 336 Divergent Economic Growth
5. ECO 345 Intermediate Price Theory
6. ECO 375 Econometrics
7. ECO 436 Econ Development
8. ECO 446 International Econ

11. **One** of the following:
	A semester abroad
	A May Term abroad
	A capstone project in international economics, supervised by a member of the economics faculty

**NOTE:** *International economics majors intending to do graduate work in international studies or intending to pursue a career with a governmental or non-governmental agency are strongly encouraged to consider a minor or major in political science or one of the International Studies tracks to complement the international economics major. Students are also encouraged to work closely with a member of the department to select complementary general education courses. *

- Private music lessons are available for credit only. Declared music majors who have achieved junior status (see @sec-class-designation) and who perform in a major ensemble are not charged for lessons. Other Coe students are charged by term according to the total registered lesson credit (see @sec-financial-information). Students who have not attended three lessons by the end of the third week of classes are dropped from music lessons and may be reinstated only by petition. After the third week of lessons, students will be charged for the full term, even if they choose to drop.
- Attendance at the numerous musical events on campus throughout the year is an essential part of the student’s musical training. Students taking lessons for 0.6 credit must attend a specific number of these events each term and the weekly Recital Hour. They must also perform in Recital Hour once each term, except for the first term of the first year of study.

## Nursing

Bursch (Chair), Dehner, Guthrie, Kittrell, Siems, Umbarger-Mackey 

A description of policies unique to the nursing department is in the *Nursing Department Student Policies Manual*. Copies of the manual are available in the Nursing Department Office, Stuart Hall 415, and online.

### The Bachelor of Science in Nursing Program

The baccalaureate nursing program is designed to prepare students for practice as professional nurses in a variety of settings. The upper division nursing courses draw upon broad and diverse knowledge gained from the liberal arts foundation to support the educational outcomes. 

Clinical experiences in the program include working with clients across the age span in a wide spectrum of practice sites. Nurse preceptors are utilized at clinical sites to provide the maximum amount of individual supervision and educational opportunity to students. Coe College nursing faculty provide clinical expertise and education by overseeing student clinical experiences, evaluating and promoting preceptor performance, and engaging in ongoing dialogue with students regarding the application of theory into practice. 

Graduates of the Bachelor of Science in Nursing degree program are eligible to take the state board licensing examination for Registered Nurses. They are also eligible for admission to graduate programs in nursing and to advanced nurse practitioner programs. The Coe College nursing program is approved by the Iowa Board of Nursing and accredited by the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education (CCNE). 

Coe College offers two paths to enter the nursing program.  Standard entry is for sophomore level (or higher) college students and direct entry is for selected high school seniors.  Details for both plans are found in the *Nursing Department Student Policies Manual*.  Copies of the manual are available in the Nursing Department Office.  At the end of the sophomore year, a student must possess valid licensure, e.g. Licensed Practical Nurse (LPN) or Certified Nursing Assistant (Direct Care Worker). A student with a revoked license from any state will NOT be admitted into the nursing program. In addition, a clinical component may not be taken by a person: a) who had been denied licensure by the State Board of Nursing, b) whose licensure is currently suspended, surrendered or revoked in any United States jurisdiction, c) whose licensure/ registration is currently suspended, surrendered or revoked in another country due to disciplinary action.

The nursing department Admission, Promotion, and Retention committee reviews applications and selects candidates who are best qualified to meet the standards of the nursing profession. Admission to the BSN degree program is competitive. Those applicants who appear to be the most qualified will be admitted. Standard and direct entry students are expected to maintain the eligibility requirements as outlined in the *Nursing Department Student Policies Manual*. 

### Departmental Notes: 

In order to successfully complete a course and be promoted to successive courses, students must:
	
- Achieve a minimum grade of C (2.0) in all nursing courses; a grade of C- (1.7) or lower requires the student to repeat the course.

#### Introductory courses {.unnumbered}

**Category A: General Introductions**

The following courses, all numbered PHL-105, are different versions of the same course. They share overlapping content and focus on the development of the same skills. Students can receive credit for only one PHL 105 Introduction to Philosophy: course.
- **PHL 105 Introduction to Philosophy:**
  Minds:
Examines what philosophers think about some of the most basic questions in life. What is real? What does it mean to have a mind? Could minds have an existence independent from our bodies? Is there anything we can know with absolute certainty? Are there objective moral values, and if so, could we know what they are? May not be taken more than once for credit.

God:
Focuses on questions about the nature and existence of God, human nature, personhood, and free will. Is there evidence for the existence of God and is the presence of suffering inthe world consistent with God's existence? Are human beings merely material beings or might we have non-physical minds or souls? What are persons and what constitutes personal identity over time? What does it mean to have free will? Do we possess free will? May not be taken more than once for credit.

Masterworks:
Central philosophical debates encountered though the examination of important classical and modern texts from the history of philosophy. Readings in the course focus on several major works from philosophers such as Plato, Descartes, Hume, Marx, and Sartre who discuss the meaning of life, belief in God, the mind-body problem, relativism of truth, and other important philosophical concerns. May not be taken more than once for credit.

Science Fiction:
Uses science fiction as a springboard for thinking about classic issues and problems in philosophy. Sci-fi classics such as The Matrix, Bladerunner, and Surrogates, raise fundamental philosophical questions such as: What the difference between appearance and reality and how can we distinguish between them? What is it to be a person? Should we think that all and only human beings can be person? What is a good human life? Is a pleasant life sufficient for living a good life? In this course such questions are examined through the lens of both philosophy and science fiction. May not be taken more than once for credit.

—SOCIAL & CRIMINAL JUSTICE
L. Barnett (Administrative Coordinator)
The Social & Criminal Justice Program offers students an opportunity to immerse themselves in an interdisciplinary major that draws from Coe’s rich tradition in the liberal arts, as well as the pre-professional opportunities at the college. Core courses in the major address multifaceted questions surrounding restorative, retributive, procedural, and distributive justice. While many programs addressing such issues are housed in the field of criminal justice studies, the SCJ faculty teach topics within the major from varying perspectives and disciplines, introducing students to the ways in which matters of justice are at work in — and essential to — many areas of study.
The major is both local and global in nature, exhibiting the possibilities and limitations of social and criminal justice initiatives in the Cedar Rapids community, while also navigating matters of human rights and comparative justice systems that reveal our connections to the broader world.
Through interdisciplinary engagement and a required practicum, the SCJ program demonstrates for students how a multiplicity of voices and viewpoints can help to shape new ideas about the impact of social justice initiatives upon the criminal justice system, and the foundations of individual and collective community engagement.
- **RHE 494 Internship in Writing**
  An internship with a focus on writing supervised by a faculty member of the department. A minimum of 140 hours on-site experience is required. S/U basis only.

## Theatre Arts

D. Barnett, Charipar, Ganfield, Hahn, Rezabek, Schmidt, Steffens, Wolverton (Chair)

The Theatre Arts program is designed to provide a balance between academic and experiential learning for all interested students. The goal is to offer opportunities for student participation in all aspects of theatre, on stage and in the classroom, and to enrich the cultural and academic life of the College. 

The program accommodates both majors and minors through courses focused on theatrical history, theory and literature, as well as through training in acting, directing, design, and theatrical production. This foundation prepares students for graduate study and for any field that values high-level communication skills, as well as for careers in theatre as teachers, artists, technicians, or managers. 

As a means of helping students prepare for graduate study and/or a professional career, all majors are required to present an audition piece or a portfolio for annual review beginning in their second year. The senior seminar provides a capstone experience, giving students an opportunity to reflect on their development as theatre artists, and to examine theatre as a collaborative art form. 

For the campus community at large, as audience members or as occasional participants, the program offers a wide range of drama selected both to educate and to entertain.
