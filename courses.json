As members of a research team working at the frontiers of knowledge, participants engage in long-range investigations using the facilities of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) near Knoxville, Tennessee. The majority of a student\u2019s time is spent in research with an advisor specializing in biology, engineering, mathematics, or the physical or social sciences. Students also participate in an interdisciplinary seminar designed to broaden their exposure to developments in their major field and related disciplines. In addition, each student chooses an elective from a variety of advanced courses. The academic program is enriched in informal ways by guest speakers, departmental colloquia, and the special interests and expertise of the ORNL staff. Administered by Denison University, Oak Ridge Science Semester is recognized by both ACM and GLCA.\r\nLearn more at http://www.acm.edu/programs/15/oakridge/index.html.", "namelink": "[OCC
