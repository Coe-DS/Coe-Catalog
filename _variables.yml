Is there evidence for the existence of God and is the presence of suffering inthe world consistent with God's existence? Are human beings merely material beings or might we have non-physical minds or souls? What are persons and what constitutes personal identity over time? What does it mean to have free will? Do we possess free will?

Readings in the course focus on several major works from philosophers such as Plato, Descartes, Hume, Marx, and Sartre who discuss the meaning of life, belief in God, the mind-body problem, relativism of truth, and other important philosophical concerns. May not be taken more than once for credit.\r\n\r\nScience Fiction:\r\nUses science fiction as a springboard for thinking about classic issues and problems in philosophy. Sci-fi classics such as The Matrix, Bladerunner, and Surrogates, raise fundamental philosophical questions such as: What the difference between appearance and reality and how can we distinguish between them? What is it to be a person? Should we think that all and only human beings can be person? What is a good human life? Is a pleasant life sufficient for living a good life? In this course such questions are examined through the lens of both philosophy and science fiction. May not be taken more than once for credit."

Barnett (Administrative Coordinator)\r\nThe Social & Criminal Justice Program offers students an opportunity to immerse themselves in an interdisciplinary major that draws from Coe’s rich tradition in the liberal arts, as well as the pre-professional opportunities at the college. Core courses in the major address multifaceted questions surrounding restorative, retributive, procedural, and distributive justice. While many programs addressing such issues are housed in the field of criminal justice studies, the SCJ faculty teach topics within the major from varying perspectives and disciplines, introducing students to the ways in which matters of justice are at work in — and essential to — many areas of study.\r\nThe major is both local and global in nature, exhibiting the possibilities and limitations of social and criminal justice initiatives in the Cedar Rapids community, while also navigating matters of human rights and comparative justice systems that reveal our connections to the broader world.\r\nThrough interdisciplinary engagement and a required practicum, the SCJ program demonstrates for students how a multiplicity of voices and viewpoints can help to shape new ideas about the impact of social justice initiatives upon the criminal justice system, and the foundations of individual and collective community engagement.'
